<p>inctures are the heraldic colours and metals used in blazonry. DrawShield supports the following tinctures.</p>

<h2>Main Tinctures</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Argent, Azure, Gules, Or, Sable, Purpure, Vert</span> (and their conventional heraldic abbreviations)</p>

<h2>Secondary Tinctures</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Murrey, Carnation, Brunatre, Bisque, Senois, Sanguine, Cendree, Rose, Celestial Azure, Tenne, Orange</span></p>

<p>ll of these tinctures are illustrated here. The exact shade will depend on the colour scheme that you chose in the options panel.</p>

<h2>Tertiary Tinctures</h2>

<p>There is a further set of colours that appear very rarely but are found in modern arms, including in American Military insignia:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">iron, bronze, copper, lead, steel, buff, red-ochre, yellow-ochre, crimson</span></p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>Heralds dislike repeating colours and will refer back to previous tinctures. The following such references are supported:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Of the field, of the first, of the second, of the third, of the fourth, of the last</span></p>

<p>In addition, if you do not provide a tincture where one is expected the next tincture encountered will be used in its place. E.g. in <span class="example">Azure a bend wavy and a chief sable</span> the wavy bend will also be coloured sable.</p>

<h2>Proper</h2>

<p>Some charges may also be described as <span class="keyword">proper</span>, in which case they will be given a tincture defined by Heraldic convention, for example a chough will be black with red beak and legs.</p>

<h2>Counterchanged</h2>

<p>If the field of the shield consists of a two coloured <a href="divisions.html" title="Divisions">division</a> then an ordinary or charge on this field may be described as <span class="keyword">counterchanged</span>. It will be coloured using the "opposite" colour from the underlying division. E.g. <span class="example">per bend azure and or, a fess counterchanged</span>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Drawshield also supports some other common colour names such as 'Red, Gold, White' etc. but it is good practice to only use the proper heraldic forms.</p>

<p>Also note that <span class="example">of the field</span> does not necessarily mean the same as <span class="example">of the first</span>. If for example the field is <span class="example">Per bend azure and or</span> then <span class="example">of the field</span> refers to the whole division, while <span class="example">of the first</span> means the first mentioned colour, which is <span class="example">azure</span>.</p>
