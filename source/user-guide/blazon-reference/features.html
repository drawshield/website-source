<p>A feature is DrawShield specific term for part of a charge that can be given a different colour from the main body. For example, in the phrase <span class="example">a lion or armed and langued gules</span> there are two features, <span class="example">armed</span> (i.e. claws) and <span class="example">langued</span> (the tongue), both of which are coloured red.</p>

<p>There are many hundreds of features that are recognised by the program. many of which are specific to only a small number of charges, however there are some features that are common to larger groups.</p>

<h2>Common Bird and Animal Features</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Armed, langued, unguled, legged, beaked, muzzled, crowned, attired, horned</span></p>

<h2>Common Weapon Features</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Shafted, heads, handled, feathered, points, blades, pomells</span></p>

<h2>Common Flower Features</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Slipped, leaved, trunked, fructed, seeded, barbed</span></p>

<p>This is only a subset of the possible features, and as usual the quickest way to find out whether a specific feature is recognised is to try it out in the "Create" page.</p>
