<p>Treatments are patterns of repeated shapes that are typically applied to the field but can also be applied to the larger ordinaries or divisions. DrawShield supports the following two colour treatments:</p>
<img src="../img/treatment1.png" alt="Further examples of treatments"  class="img-fluid" />
<p><span class="keyword">annuletty, billetty, checky, checky-of-9, compony, counter-billetty, crusily, ermined, estoilly, fretty, goutty, grillage, honeycombed, lozengy, maily, masoned, mulletty, papelonny, plumetty, potenty, scaly, seme-de-lys, vairy</span></p>

<p>By default, <span class="example">mulletty</span> has the field strewn with five pointed stars. Alternatively you may use <span class="example">mulletty of n points</span>; where n can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 and the word &quot;points&quot; is optional.</p>

<p>The following treatments with fixed colour roundels are also supported:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">bezanty, hurty, platy</span></p>

<h2>Seme Fields</h2>

<p>It is also possible to create your own treatments by defining a field &quot;strewn&quot; with charges, for exammple <span class="example">argent seme de bees or</span>, a white field scattered with yellow bees.</p>
