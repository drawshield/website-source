<!-- /blazon-reference/index.ejs starts -->

<p>This section contains a reasonably good list of all the heraldic terms that DrawShield can display, i.e. all the words in <span class="keyword">a bold font</span> on the pages below. There are a few points to note:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Variant spellings and alternative words for the same thing are not usually included (this would probably triple the size of the guide!)</li>
	<li>There are additional terms that may be recognised but can't (yet) be drawn - although in some cases a sensible error message is generated</li>
	<li>These pages are maintained by hand and may be slightly out of date with the actual program code</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons it is fair to say that the best way to find out if DrawShield can draw a particular item is to try it out in a blazon on the create page!</p>
