<p>There is an enormous variety of geometric shapes available to the Herald, possibly because they are quite easy to draw!</p>

<h2>Simple Shapes</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Annulets, billet, cartouche, chevron, crescent, delf, escutcheon, fret, fusil, goutte, lozenge, octagon, icicle, mascle, mullet, roundel, rustre, saltorel, square, triangle</span></p>

<h3>Shape Modifiers</h3>

<p>Some of the shapes may be <span class="keyword">voided, pierced</span>. The mascle can also be drawn <span class="example">ploye</span>.</p>

<p>Up to 10 <span class="example">annulets</span> may be drawn <span class="keyword">one within the other</span> (i.e. as concentric circles), or <span class="keyword">interlaced</span>; two annulets can also be drawn <span class="example">braced</span> or <span class="example">conjunct</span>; and single annulets can be formed <span class="example">of rope</span> or <span class="example">of chain</span></p>

<p>The <span class="example">mullet</span> may be drawn  <span class="keyword">of N points</span> where 'N' is 5 to 10, and some of those numbers are also available as either <span class="example">voided</span> or <span class="example">interlaced.</span></p>

<h2>Named Roundels</h2>

<p>Roundels are such common charges that each colour roundel has its own special name, so it is an error if these are given a colour. These are:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Bezant, golpe, guze, hurt, orange, pellet, plate, pomme, torteau</span></p>

<p>The matching of name to heraldic tincture is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">heraldic fountain</span> is also available, being a roundel wavy azure and argent, not to be confused with the architectural feature of the same name.</p>

<h2>Symbols</h2>

<p>The following symbols are also availabe (but see also the category of <a href="crosses.html" title="Crosses" target="">Crosses</a>).</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Ankh, caduceus, chi-rho, compass rose, compass star, cornucopia, ermine spot, fasces, fleur-de-lys, labyrinth, nesselblatt, triskelion, triskele, Star of David, menorah, pentagram, pentacle, question mark, valknut</span></p>
<p>The <span class="example">menorah</span> by default has 7 branches but you may also use <span class="example">a menorah of 9 branches</span>, both versions may be <span class="example">enflamed</span> of a different colour. The <span class="example">triskelion</span> by default is a simple spiral, but can be <span class="example">armoured</span> to appear as 3 armoured legs, as found in the arms of the Isle of Man, or alternatively formed <span class="example">of spirals</span>. Finally, the <span class="example">nesselblatt</span> is a stylised nettle leaf found in German heraldy.</p>

<p>Astronomical symbols are also available, using the form <span class="keyword">the astronomical character of the planet X</span> where 'X' is one of <span class="keyword">Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Moon, Neptune, Pluto, Saturn, Sun, Uranus, Venus</span></p>

<p>And, similarly (and with some overlap) there are also alchemical symbols, using the form <span class="keyword">the alchemical symbol for Y</span> where 'Y' is one of <span class="keyword">Earth, air, water, fire, salt, iron, sulphur, gold, iron, tin, silver</span>.</p>
