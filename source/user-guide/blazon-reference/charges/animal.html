<p>Animals are frequently seen on heraldic shields. DrawShield provides the following lifelike animals.</p>

<h2>Animal Groups</h2>

<h3>Game Animals</h3>

<p><span class="keyword">antler, boar, boar's head, reindeer, reindeer head, stag, stag's head, deer, hare, hind</span></p>

<h3>Livestock &amp; Farm Animals</h3>

<p><span class="keyword">calf, cock, cow, goat, bull's head, hen, horse, horse's head, ox, ram, sheep</span></p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">serpent</span> is rather stylised in appearance, for a winged version use <span class="keyword">amphitere</span>, alternatively, for a more realistic appearance use <span class="keyword">snake</span>.</p>

<h3>Sea and River Life</h3>

<p><span class="keyword">barbel, calamarie, catfish, carp, chabot, crab, natural dolphin, eel, goldfish, herring, killer whale, lobster, manatee, pike, polypus, salmon, scallop, natural sea-horse, shrimp, whale, whelk, shell (triton's trumpet), sea tortoise</span> and there is also a generic <span class="keyword">fish</span>. The whale can  be any combination of <span class="keyword">spouting</span> and <span class="keyword">embowed</span>.</p>

<h2>Animal Variations</h2>

<h3>Stances and Postures</h3>

<p>Some animals are available in different postures, in particular the lions can be drawn in  postures such as <span class="keyword">rampant, passant, cadent, couchant, courant, salient, sejeant, passant, statant</span>, with its head <span class="keyword">guardant, reguardant</span> and its tail <span class="keyword">fourche, nowed, saltire</span> and possibly some others. You can specify any combination of the above and DrawShield will use the closest available, warning about anything it cannot handle.</p>

<p>Similarly other creatures may have different postures but at present most animals are available in a single pose. Again, warning messages will be generated if your pose cannot be shown.</p>

<h3>Features and Modifiers</h3>

<p>Many animals may have parts of their bodies drawn in different colours, the most common being <span class="keyword">armed, langued, hooved, legged</span> but there may be others, again try them and see what works. There is a special term for the "comb" of cocks and hens, which is <span class="keyword">jelloped</span>.</p>

<p>There are other modifiers that may also be available, for example <span class="keyword">lion's head crowned</span>.</p> 

<h3>The Leopard</h3>

<p>The leopard has a complex relationship with heraldry and its representation has changed over time. DrawShield implements the leopard as follows:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard</span></dt>
	<dd>This is treated as a synonym for <span class="keyword">Lion passant guardant</span> and drawn the same way. This is also the case for <span class="keyword">lion leoparde</span>.</dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Natural Leopard</span></dt>
	<dd>(Or  <span class="keyword">Spotted Leopard</span>) is the heraldic version of the actual leopard. It may be <span class="keyword">Spotted</span> of a different tincture, in which case it is probably best to use a construction such as <span class="keyword">a natural leopard or spotted sable</span></dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard's Head</span></dt>
	<dd>Is the heraldic version of the actual leopard's head.</dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard (head) jessant de lys</span></dt>
	<dd>Is the peculiar but common Heraldic charge consisting of a Leopard's Head pierced by a fleur-de-lys. The Fleur-de-lys can be a different tincture, e.g. <span class="keyword">a leopard's head gules jessant-de-lys or</span>.</dd>
