<p>You might want to think of this category as "big stuff".

<h2>Buildings and Architectural Features</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Arch, double arch, bascule, castle, church, cogwheel, cramp, millwheel, pillar, tower, tower triple towered, waterwheel, natural fountain, bridge, windmill, portcullis, quadrate cornice, well frame</span>
</p>

<p>The windmill can have <span class="keyword">sails</span> of a different tincture.</p>

<p>The bridge can also be <span class="keyword">of two arches</span> or <span class="example">of three arches</span> </p>

<p>Many heraldic castles are described in great detail, but at the moment DrawShield treats them all equally and just draws the same castle.</p>

<p>The <span class="example">natural fountain</span> is a spray of water from a stone bowl, as opposed to a <span class="example">heraldic fountain</span> which is a type of roundel. There is also a <span class="example">fountain stone</span> available which has no water flowing.</p>

<h2>Ships and the Sea</h2>

<p><span class="keyword">Anchor, caravel, coracle, fishing boat, ship, galley</span></p>

<p>Many heraldic ships are described in great detail, but at the moment DrawShield treats them all equally and just draws the same ship.</p>
