<h2>Monograms and Letters</h2>

<p>Sets of initials or single letters can be drawn in a heavy, gothic form using any of the charge names <span class="keyword">monogram, letters, cypher</span>, for example <span class="example">the monogram "kw" sable</span>, or <span class="example">the letter "R" vert</span>. In this case the quotation marks are optional but are recommended for readability.</p>

<p>You can change the font used by using constructions like:
<span>Argent, the letter "K" in a script font azure</span> or
<span>Sable, the letters "AD" or, in the serif style</span>
And so on. The currently supported fonts are "gothic", "plain", "serif" and "script" (and you can use "face" instead of "font").</p>

<p>One caveat, when positioning letters the program does NOT consider any descenders (like the tail of the 'y'), if you find the letter isn't quite where you want you can modify them with the adjustments "shown smaller than normal", "higher", "to the sinister" or whatever.</p>

<h2>Numbers and Digits</h2>

<p>Single or multiple digits can be drawn, also in a heavy gothic font. Use either of the charges <span class="keyword">number, digit</span>. The number may be given either as digits or in words, in which case the words MUST be enclosed in quotation marks. For example <span class="example">the digit "5" gules</span>, or <span class="example">the number "nineteen hundred and sixty four" sable</span>. Numbers described in words up to around 100,000 will probably be recognised correctly.</p>

<h2>Other Words</h2>

<p>If you wish to write things upon your shield, the following charges are available.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">The roman 'X'</span>where 'X' runs from 'A' to 'Z', but this time the letter is a proper text letter using a Serif font and is thus much more readable.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">The word 'X'</span> where 'X' is any string of letters. For multiple words, enclose them in double quotes, but note that the words do not "wrap" and so you end up with a long, thin charge. Words are drawn in a readable, serif font.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><span class="example">the word "ten" sable</span> shows the charge as "ten"</li>
<li><span class="example">the number "ten" sable</span> will show the charge as "10"</li>
<li>For more control over the appearance of text see the (NON-STANDARD!) <a href="../../extensions/text-effects.html">"Text Effects" theme pack</a></li>
</ul>
