<h2>Normal Positions</h2>

<p>If you simply specify a number of charges they will auotmatically be arranged across the field. See the discussion on <a href="arrangements.html" title="Arrangements">arrangements</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Specific Locations</h2>

<p>Charges may be placed in a specific location by prefixing or appending the charge descriptions with one of the following:</p>

<p>Central locations (from top to bottom) <span class="keyword">In Middle chief, in base, in honour point, in fess point, in nombril,in abyss</span></p>

<p>Side locations - <span class="keyword">in dexter/sinister chief, in dexter/sinister flank, in dexter/sinister base, in flank</span> (the last puts a copy of the requested charge in <em>each</em> flank</p>

<p>In quarters - <span class="keyword">in first/second/third/fourth quarter</span></p>

<p>In shield halves - <span class="keyword">in dexter/sinister side/half, in upper/lower half/part</span>. These are not strictly heraldic constructions but are a useful "fudge" until DrawShield does a better job with shields split into two distinct parts (such as those common in European Heraldry).</p>

<h2>With Ordinaries</h2>

<p>You can place charges <span class="keyword">on</span> an ordinary. In most cases he space available to do this is quite restricted some only a small number of charges is allowed, an error message will be generated if there isn't room to place all of the charges. Similarly, some numbers of charges don't really make sense on some ordinaries, again an error message will be shown if this is the case.</p>

<p>You can also place charges in relation to an ordinary by using the contsruction <span class="example">ordinary</span> <span class="keyword">between</span> <span class="example">number charges</span>, or <span class="example">number charges</span> <span class="keyword">within</span> <span class="example">ordinary</span>. As usual this only makes sense for certain ordinaries with particular numbers of charges.</p>

<p>Particularly with the <span class="keyword">bordure</span> it is also possible to use the construction <span class="keyword">within [an ordinary] [one or more charges]</span>.</p>

<h2>In Relation to Other Charges</h2>

<p>See <a href="arrangements.html">the discussion of charge arrangements</a>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Note that <span class="example">in chief</span> is an arrangement, NOT a location (compare with <span class="example">in pale, in fess</span>). What you probably mean is <span class="example">in middle chief</span>.</p>
