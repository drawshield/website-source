<h2>Orientation of Charges</h2>

<p>Most charges have a default orientation - i.e. they normally face in a set direction and have a defined "upright" position. This can be changed by using the following modifiers after the charge. They can be used in combination also.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">inverted</span> flipped top to bottom</p>

<p><span class="keyword">reversed</span> flipped left to right</p>

<p><span class="keyword">fesswise</span> If the charge is "tall", lay it on its side. The direction it points in depends on the type of charge</p>

<p><span class="keyword">palewise</span> If the charge is "wide", turn it to stand up straight</p>

<p><span class="keyword">bendwise, bendwise sinister</span> Rotate 45 degrees to the right or left, respectively</p>

<h3>Orientation and Arrangements</h3>

<p>Although orientation may seem to the same concept as arrangement, it is different because you can combine both orientation and arrangement, for example charges may be <span class="example">fesswise in pale</span> (orientated in a particular arrangement), and this is different from <span class="example">in pale</span> on its own.</p>

<h2>Orientation of Ordinaries</h2>

<p>With ordinaries, the only modifiers for orientation that can be used are <span class="keyword">reversed</span> and <span class="keyword">inverted</span>; these are pretty interchangeable and usually mean "the other way around".</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>When charges are placed <span class="example">on</span> an ordinary they will sometimes automatically have an orientation applied to better match them to the ordinary, for example birds are typically orientated <span class="example">bendwise sinister</span> when placed <span class="example">on a bend</span>. This can be over-ridden by specifying your own orientation.</p>
