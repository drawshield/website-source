    <p style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</p>
    <p>Drawing the full achievement of arms should be considered as a "beta-test". Both the syntax 
        (form of words) and the implementation (visual appearance) may change in response to user
        feedback. Please let me know your own thoughts and ideas using the contact link in the 
        menu above.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Blazonry has a long history of precision in describing the shield itself (known as the escutcheon when 
    we come to talk the full achievement). This means that when it comes to tinctures, ordinaries, 
    divisions and all the component parts of the escutcheon there is widespread agreement on what
    everything means, and this is backed by a large body of evidence.
</p>
<p>Sadly, the same does not seem to be true for the rest of the component parts of the full
    achievement of arms. How should we describe the colours of the mantling, style of helmet
    and so on? I have tried where possible to follow similar practice to that found on the
    escutcheon but there is little actual precedence for this style of language, and hence it is 
    subject to change and further discussion!
</p>
<h2>Overall Organisation</h2>
<p>To keep things simple I am requiring that <strong>all</strong> of the escutcheon description comes
first and the achievement description comes afterwards. To make this even clearer you can if you wish
use the word <strong>achievement</strong> to mark the start of the achievement description. See the 
examples below.</p>
<p>You can specify as many, or as few of the mantling parts as you wish and the others will take
    a default appearance. (Except for the motto, which will only appear if it is specified).
</p>
<h2>Helmet</h2>
<p>At present there are four styles of helmet available, selected using one of the phrases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Royal helmet</li>
    <li>A peer's helmet / a lord's helmet</li>
    <li>A baronet's helmet</li>
    <li>An esquire's helmet / a gentleman's helmet</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not specify a helmet type then an esquire's helmet will be shown.</p>
<p>Helmets have a default colour depending on the type, but you can override this by following the word helmet with a tincture. Only plain colours are currently supported.</p>
<p>Using any helmet other than the default is <strong>NOT</strong> heraldically correct, so its use is discouraged.</p>
<h2>Torse</h2>
<p>It is also possible to position a <em>torse</em> on the helmet, this is a twisted loop of decorative rope and may have up to two plain colours. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>torse gules and azure</li>
</ul>

<p>No torse will be shown unless it is actually specified, so you can just use the word alone. The default colours, if none are provided are argent and grey, matching the default mantling.</p>
<h2>Crest</h2>
<p>The word <em>crest</em> can be used to indicate a small charge which will be placed as if rising
    from the helmet, for example <em>crest a lion gules</em>. As there are many combinations of charges
and helmets the default placement will probably not always work. You can use the <a href="/user-guide/extensions/charge-adjustments.html"> charge adjustments extension</a> to tweak the size and position, especially using the <em>slightly</em> prefix to make very small adjustments.</p>
<h2>Mantling</h2>
<p>At present there is one type of mantling available, in the form of ribbons, however I
    hope to add other types soon. It is selected using either of the phrases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>mantling</li>
    <li>lambrequin</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase can be followed by <em>of ribbons</em> if you want to insulate yourself from
future additional mantling types.</p>
<h3>Ribbon Mantling Colours</h3>
<p>By default the ribbon mantling will be drawn gray and white, however up to four colours
    can be applied. If one colour is given it will replace the white, if two colours are
    given then they will replace the white and gray respectively. However, you can give
    different colours to each side of the mantling using:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>to the dexter colour (and colour)</li>
    <li>to the sinister colour (and colour)</li>
</ul>
<p>In which case the above rules apply but to each side of the mantling separately.</p>
<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>You may also add a motto, which if given will be shown in a scroll at the bottom of the
    shield. If the motto is longer than one word then you <strong>MUST</strong> enclose it
    in double quotes, <em>"like this"</em>. An attempt is made to adjust the font size to
    fit in all the text, strings up to about 30 characters in length can be accommodated.
</p>
<p>Using the motto to hold a family name will incure the wrath of Heraldic purists. You have been
    warned.
</p>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Per bend azure and or</dt>
    <dd>Works the normal way, the escutcheon only will occupy the whole of the image</dd>
    <dt>Per bend azure and or achievement</dt>
    <dd>Will produce a basic achievement, with plain mantling and an esquire's helmet</dd>
    <dt>Per bend azure and or mantling or and gules</dt>
    <dd>An achievement with coloured mantling and an esquire's helmet</dd>
    <dt>Per bend azure and or mantling to the sinister or to the dexter azure a royal helmet</dt>
    <dd>An achievement with mantling different each side and a Royal helmet</dd>
    <dt>Per bend azure and or motto "Drawshield Est"</dt>
    <dd>An achievement with plain mantling, an esquire's helmet with torse and a scroll containing the
        motto "For Valour"
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>And if you want to go all the way you can use constructions like:</p>
<p><strong>Per bend azure and or achievement with a royal helmet argent crest a lion gules mantling of ribbons to the dexter azure and argent to the sinister or and argent motto "Drawshield Est"</strong></p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>For artistic reasons the <em>shiny</em> effect is applied only to the escutcheon, all the other effects are 
applied to the entire achievement.</p>
