<h2>Creating Fabric Patterns.</h2>

<p>The code that creates normal heraldic treatments is very flexible and was easily modified to produce fabric like patterns.
Although not remotely Heraldic they are included here in the hope that they might be useful for something. You can if you
want to use them as the field for your arms but heraldic purists are unlikely to be happy about it!</p>

<h3>Plaid Patterns</h3>

<p>These patterns are based on those illustrated and discussed on this <a href="https://www.plaidlover.com/different-types-plaid-pattern/">
    Plaid Lovers</a> page. The patterns available are <strong>buffalo check, gingham, glen check</strong>
    (or <strong>Prince of Wales check</strong>),
    <strong>graph check, houndstooth</strong> and
    <strong>shepherd check</strong>. </p>

<p>These work exactly the same way as treatments and must be followed by two tinctures.</p>

<p>To see the appearance of these patterns look at the <a href="/catalog/treatments/fabric/index.html">visual catalog page.</a></p>


<h3>Tartan Patterns</h3>

<p>Tartan patterns don't really fall into the heraldic way of doing things but it seemed a shame not to implement so I have
    added a small extra piece of syntax to allow them to be drawn. The implementation here is based on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan#Construction">Wikipedia discussion here</a>, with additional
    information from <a href="https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/">the official Scottish Tartan Register</a>.</p>

    <p>The pattern name is (obviously) <em>tartan</em> and this
should be followed by a series of colour names and thread widths. (Note that <strong>only</strong> colours may be used, not any
other type of tincture). Thread widths are given as numbers. You should assume that there are 500 threads across the field, hence
if your total thread widths add up to 50 your pattern will repeat 5 times across the full width. (Each pattern is 100 x 100 threads
        because of the mirrored repeat). So, for example:</p>
.
<p><em>tartan ancient black 4 scarlet 24 ancient black 24 yellow 4</em></p>

<p>Produces the rather lovely pattern:</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/user-guide/extensions/img/tartan1.png" alt="Tartan swatch" />

<p>Some tartan patterns use large (>100) or small (<20) total thread counts, and DrawShield will attempt to do some crude scaling
in these cases to keep the tartan pattern size to similar dimensions as other treatments.</p>

<p>Note that using the tartan pattern will <em>automatically enable</em> the extra tartan colour set. You can use as many
colour / thread count pairs as required, at least 4 for a proper "tartan" appearance.
	If required, a semi-colon can be used to separate the tartan description from any following
content, and commas may be used between each item. You are not limited to tartan colours, but can use any of the colour sets
that you have enabled (see below).</p>

<p>The referenced sources both mention rare cases in which the tartan pattern does <strong>not</strong> repeat in a mirror
image. For this situation use the construction <em>tartan no repeat</em> followed by the colours and thread counts
as normal.</p>

<p>You will sometimes find tartan specified in a compact form, like <em>K4 R24 K24 Y4</em>, where the letters reference a colour and the numbers are the count of threads for the associated colour. You can use these directly in a blazon but you
   <strong>MUST</strong> enclose them in double quotes, e.g. <em>tartan "K4 R24 K24 Y4"</em>. Alternatively,
	if you would like to see the full colour names then a convertor for this process is provided below.</p>

<p>If you obtain threadcounts from the Scottish Tartan register above you may also find that the compact form also includes a "pallet" (their spelling) which describes the colours more precisely. These <strong>cannot</strong> be used directly with DrawShield, but you can use the convertor below which will produce a form usable in DrawShield. Also look out for the phrase: </p>

<p><em>Threadcount given over a half sett with full count at the pivots.</em></p>

<p>This means that the first and last counts should be halved for use in DrawShield - tick the box marked "Full count at the
pivots?" if you see this phrase and the convertor will automatically make the appropriate adjustments.</p>

<script src="tartan.js" ></script>
		<form>
			<div class="form-group">
				<p>Converts standard tartan descriptions into a form usable by DrawShield</p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label class="description" for="tartan">Threadcount </label>
				<input id="tartan" name="tartan" class="form-control" type="text" maxlength="255" value=""/>
				<p class="guidelines" id="guide_1"><small>Enter tartan components e.g. K4 R24 K24 Y4</small></p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label class="description" for="pallete">Pallet  (if given) </label>
				<input id="pallete" name="tartan" class="form-control" type="text" maxlength="255" value=""/>
				<p class="guidelines" id="guide_2"><small>Enter pallet sepcification e.g. K=101010BLACK;...</small></p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<input type="checkbox" class="form-control" id="full-count">
				<label class="description" for="full-count">Full count at the pivots?</label>
				<p class="guidelines" id="guide_3"><small>This is usually stated after the pallet</small></p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label class="description" for="blazon">DrawShield Blazon </label>
				<textarea id="blazon" name="blazon" class="form-control"></textarea>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group row">
				<div class="col">
					<input onclick="tartanToBlazon();" class="button_text" type="button" name="submit" value="Convert" />
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<input onclick="tartanToBlazon();" class="button_text" type="reset" name="reset" value="Clear" />
				</div>
			</div>
		</form>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The colour mixing that occurs when threads "overlap" is very crude and not based on any physically realistic process.
I might change this in the future if anyone reports it to be a problem.</p>

<h3>Tattersall Pattern</h3>

<p>The Plaid Lover's site referenced above also includes a fabric pattern known as <em>Tattersall</em>. This has 3 colours
so doesn't really fit into the heraldic treatment paradigm,however it can be simulated by using the tartan pattern - the
photograph on the plaid lover's can be simulated by entering <em> tartan gules 3 argent 36 brunatre 3</em>.</p>

<h3>Additional Colours</h3>

<p>For fabric design purposes you may find it useful to turn on the additional colour sets <em>named wed</em> and <em>tartan</em>
as <a href="/user-guide/extensions/extra-colours.html">discussed here</a>. As noted above, using the tartan pattern automatically
enables the tartan colour set.</p>

<h3>Visual Appearance</h3>

<p>Since these patterns are not really heraldic it may not seem appropriate to display on a shield. As an alternative
you may wish to the shape <em>swatch</em>, which is chosen from the drop-down <strong>Preferences</strong> pane
and is intended to look like a material sample. Alternatively you can append <em>drawn using the swatch shape</em> to the
end of the blazon</p>

<p>In addition, there is a visual effect which can be applied, specifically created for these patterns, <em>Fabric</em>. This
can also be selected from the drop-down <strong>Preferences</strong> menu, or by appending <em>drawn using the fabric effect</em> to
the end of the blazon. Note that this effect darkens the colours somewhat, so may always be suitable, but it does like nice, especially
on tartans, which are very subdued anyway.</p>
