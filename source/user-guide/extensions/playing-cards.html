<p>Heraldry long predates playing cards but they can make useful charges. This theme pack contains the following items:</p>

<h2>The Suit Symbols</h2>

<p>The following charges representing the four suits are available:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">playing card club, playing card diamond, playing card space, playing card heart</span></p>

<p>Note that these are <em>different</em> charges to proper heraldic charges with similar names. For brevity you can use <span class="keyword">card club</span> for example (but NOT just <span class="keyword">club</span>). The symbols are always the appropriate colour so any tincture given is ignored, but you can use <span class="keyword">proper</span> if desired.</p>

<h2>The Card Characters</h2>

<p>The following charges showing the characters found on the cards are available:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Jack, Queen, King, Joker</span></p>

<p>The characters are always of fixed colours so any tincture given is ignored, but you can use <span class="keyword">proper</span> if desired.</p>

<h2>Individual Playing Cards</h2>

<p>All of the individual playing cards can be used, for example <span class="keyword">playing card eight of hearts</span>, or just <span class="keyword">king of clubs</span>. The playing cards are always the appropriate colour so any tincture given is ignored, but you can use <span class="keyword">proper</span> if desired. You can also use <span class="keyword">card red joker</span> or <span class="keyword">card black joker</span>.</p>

<p>In addition, you can also have a card face down with <span class="keyword">card back</span>, in this case the tincture of the card back <em>must</em> be given.</p>

<h2>Hands of Cards</h2>

<p>Groups of 5 cards held in a fan arrangement are also available, you can have  a <span class="keyword">winning hand of playing cards</span>, a <span class="keyword">losing hand of playing cards</span>, or just <span class="keyword">a hand of cards</span>. You can shorten the first two, for example just <span class="keyword">a winning hand</span>.</p>

<h2>Other Games</h2>

<p>You can also use individual chess pieces, <span class="keyword">chess king, chess queen, chess pawn, chess bishop, chess knight, chess castle</span></p>
