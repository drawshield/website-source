<h2>The "Demi" Charges</h2>

<p>In standard Heraldry a charge can be prefixed by <em>demi</em>, in which case only half of the charge will be shown. There is a heraldic convention by which animals are shown with their top halves, and most other things are shown with only the sinister half. </p>

<p>DrawShield (more or less) adheres to this convention, and charges that are not shown correctly can easily be changed, just let us know if you think any are wrongly split!</p>

<h2>The "Half" Extensions</h2>

<p>To give the user more precise control over displaying just half of a charge, the following prefixes may also be used:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>sinister half</em></li>
    <li><em>dexter half</em></li>
    <li><em>upper half</em></li>
    <li><em>lower half</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The effect should be obvious. <em>Top</em> and <em>bottom</em> are acceptable synonyms, as is <em>part</em> in place of half. Examples of use are:</p>

<p><em>The sinister half of a mullet</em></p>
<p><em>2 lower halves of mullets</em></p>
<p><em>an upper part of a bull rampant</em></p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Although this is not directly heraldic it seems a reasonable extension as it is perfectly acceptable English.</p>

<p>In addition however, the code is required anyway as part of a future implementation of charges which are described as<em>issuant from</em>.</p>
