<p>This set of charges and ordinaries is based on the space imagery of the 1930's and is intended to create shields and badges for organisations involved in the exploration of space!</p>

<h2>Charges</h2>

<p>The following theme charges are available:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">planet, raygun, rocket ship, atom, space station, rocket man, star, spiral galaxy, sputnik, planet earth</span></p>

<p>The <span class="example">rocket ship</span> and the <span class="example">rocket man</span> may both be <span class="keyword">enflamed</span> of a different colour. The <span class="example">planet</span> may be <span class="keyword">ringed</span> of different colour. The <span class="example">planet earth</span> may be described as <span class="keyword">proper</span>. </p>

<h2>Ordinaries</h2>

<p>The following ordinaries may be described as <span class="keyword">riveted</span>, in which case they will have small grey rivet heads along their primary edges. Please let me know if you would like me to add more to this list.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">chief, fess, bend, bend sinister, base, plain cross, chevron</span></p>

<p>The <span class="example">bends</span> and <span class="example">cross</span> are correctly <span class="example">riveted</span> if there is a <span class="example">chief</span> present, but not if they are <span class="example">couped</span>.</p>

<h2>Divisions</h2>

<p>Similarly, the following major divisions may also be <span class="keyword">riveted</span>, in which lines of rivets appear either side of the division line:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">per fess, per bend, per pale, per chevron, tierced in pale, tierced in fess, tierced in bend</span></p>
