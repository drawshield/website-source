<p>In heraldry, a <em>treatment</em> is a regular, repeating pattern of two plain colours. 
    For your viewing pleasure we present the following extension, which allows us to use
gradients of two colours instead.</p>

<h2>Gradients</h2>

<p>This extension adds the following (very non-standard!) terms to the list of supported treatments:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="keyword">grady in fess [colour] and [colour]</span> - A gradual transition from left to right</li>
<li><span class="keyword">grady in pale [colour] and [colour]</span> - A gradual transition from top to bottom</li>
<li><span class="keyword">grady in bend [colour] and [colour]</span> - A gradual transition from top left to bottom right</li>
<li><span class="keyword">grady in bend sinister [colour] and [colour]</span> - A gradual transition from top right to bottom left</li>
<li><span class="keyword">grady in annulo [colour] and [colour]</span> - A gradual transition from the outer edge to the inside</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword">graded</span> is a synonym for grady, and in common with other treatments, the first colour may 
come before the treatment name (e.g. <span class="keyword">azure grady in pale argent</span>).</p>

<h2>Grady on Major Ordinaries</h2>

<p>For the sake of brevity, with the major ordinaries such as <span class="keyword">fess, pale, bend</span> etc. you
can just the construction <span class="keyword">grady [colour] and [colour]</span> and the gradient will follow
the direction of the ordinary. If this is not the behaviour that you want then you can still specify the
gradient direction, for example <span class="keyword">a pale grady in fess gules and or</span>.</p>

<p>You can actually use <span class="keyword">grady [colour] and [colour]</span> anywhere, and if it is
<strong>NOT</strong> used on an ordinary then it will take the default valued of <span class="keyword">grady in pale</span>,
however users are discouraged from taking advantage of this construction. Unless you are shading a major ordinary
then I recommend always using a specific direction for clarity.</p>

<h2>Grady of a Single Colour</h2>

<p>Heraldry has a rather limited palette of colours so it might be difficult to get a pair of colours to 
    create a pleasing gradient. For this reason, you can also specify <span class="keyword">grady [direction] [colour]</span>,
in which a gradient will be created that runs from a lighter shade of the given colour to a darker shade, in the given direction. The
actual colour will be the middle value. You can also use <span class="keyword">grady [direction] inverted 
    [colour]</span> to make the gradient run from a darker shade to a lighter shade in the given direction.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>These gradients work best on large simple shapes, such as the field, major ordinaries and simple geometric charges.
    They do not work as intended on charges made up of many individual parts (such as lions) but the effect is not displeasing -
    try it out!
