<h2>Contact Menu</h2>

<p>This is the place to keep up to date with recent and planned changes, and contact the author about general matters.</p>

<p>The various sections are discussed briefly below:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>View Responses</dt>
	<dd>This is just a mirror of the @drawshield twitter feed and is the place to get the absolute up-to-minute news about the site. I also try to respond to error reports and other messages as soon as I can using this feed.</dd>
	<dt>View To Do List</dt>
	<dd>I'm not very good at keeping a single to-do list and this is currently not very accurate. I need to think about this one a bit more!</dd>
	<dt>View Change Log</dt>
	<dd>This is pretty accurate, every new release (that changes the actual version number) is described in some detail here. I do tiny fixes and add new charges or alternate spellings on the "live" system and these do not trigger a version number increment.</dd>
	<dt>View Blog Posts</dt>
	<dd>I'm hoping to use this section a bit more to give longer answers to some queries and also put down my thoughts on various computational heraldry topics.</dd>
	<dt>Contact the Author</dt>
	<dd>My contact details, for issues and questions that don't seem to fit in anywhere else!</dd>
