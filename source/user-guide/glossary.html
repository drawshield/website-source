pageTitle: Glossary of DrawShield Terms
---

<!-- user-guide/glossary.ejs starts -->
<p>You will find the following terms used in the user guide (and in
DrawShield error messages). They typically are very closely related to
their conventional use in blazonry and Heraldry books, but as there are
sometimes slight variations and additional terms I have defined exactly
what I mean by them below.</p>

<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-3">Arrangement</dt><dd class="col-9"> When there is more than one charge, the
arrangement describes how the charges are placed in relation to each
other.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Blazon</dt><dd class="col-9"> Shield description, using the language of
blazonry.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Charge</dt><dd class="col-9"> An item that can be located in various locations
on the shield, it may appear multiple times and in various orientations
and arrangements. Some authorities include ordinaries as charges but it
will help you understand and use DrawShield if you agree to consider
ordinaries and charges as very separate things!</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Field</dt><dd class="col-9"> The underlying colour or pattern of the shield,
typically the first thing described in the blazon.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Feature</dt><dd class="col-9"> This is a DrawShield specific term which
means a part of a charge that can be given a different colour from the
main body of the charge. Charges may have multiple features, each of
which can be given their own colour. Note the use of the word "colour"
here, DrawShield currently restricts features to being plain colours
or metals only.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Fur</dt><dd class="col-9"> A repeating shape that creates patterns with fixed
colours. They can be used to colourise any item.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Metal</dt><dd class="col-9"> This is a heraldic term for the colours
<span class="example">or</span> and <span class="example">argent</span>. For most purposes, DrawShield treats
metals just like any other plain colour, there are however heraldic
guidelines about using colours on metals and metals next to each other.
DrawShield does not at present implement these guidelines but in future
they may trigger warnings if they are breached.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Modifier</dt><dd class="col-9"> This is a DrawShield specific term which
means additional information that further describes a charge and how it
appears. For example, the stance of an animal, how its tail is laid out
or whether a cross has a hole in it.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Ordinary</dt><dd class="col-9"> A shaped item that always occupies the same
location on the field of the shield. Some authorities combine charges
and ordinaries but DrawShield treats them as different classes of
item, with different options available.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Orientation</dt><dd class="col-9"> Most charges are not symmetrical and have a
particular "default" way that they face. The orientation describes this,
and how it may be changed to face a different direction, be upside down
and so on.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Placement</dt><dd class="col-9"> This is a DrawShield specific term that
sometimes appear in error messages. Based on the number, orientation,
arrangement and location of a charge, the program tries to calculate its
placement - i.e. a specific "box" on the shield that can contain the
charge. Sometimes due to shortcomings in the program code, or due to
conflicting information in the blazon it may not be possible to
calculate this placement correctly.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Position</dt><dd class="col-9"> The location of a group of charges, or a
single charge on the field of the shield.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Tincture</dt><dd class="col-9"> The colouration or pattern of an item on the
shield. This may a plain colour, a treatment, a fur or a division. In
this user guide, I generally use <span class="example">tincture</span> when any of these
options are available, and <span class="example">colour</span> when only a plain colour or
metal can be used.</dd>

<dt class="col-3">Treatment</dt><dd class="col-9"> Various repeating shapes that create patterns
of two colours and can be used to colourise items.</dd>
</dl>
