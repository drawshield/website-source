pageTitle: Guide to British Heraldry Reference Sources
---
<p>I needed some reference sources for my <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/holc">Heraldry of Lincoln Cathedral Project</a> and found many heraldic works freely available on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>. Unfortunately there were very few reviews or guidance on which were most useful so I have provided some here! All views (and any mistakes) are my own.</p>

<h2>Selection Criteria</h2>

<p>To select the most useful I assessed them against the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Available offline, ideally in PDF format (for use when not connected and for ease of searching)</li>
	<li>The most recent version (where multiple editions exist)</li>
	<li>Fully text searchable, with the ability to cut and paste text</li>
	<li>Authoritative (i.e. recognised authors, comprehensive content)</li>
	<li>Good quality reproductions of both the original text and diagrams (in colour)</li>
	<li>Coverage primarily of <strong>British </strong>Heraldlry</li>
</ul>

<h2>The List</h2>

<p>This then is the resulting list. The links in the middle column go directly to the appropriate page on archive.org, the link in the right hand column is to additional page on this site, which lists the contents, quality and other information about the work. I have also included these comments in a review of each book on the archive.org site, each review is titled "<em>Bookshelf of British Heraldry"</em> but I can't guarantee that they will stay near the top!
</p>

<p>If you are trying to use these resources to identify some heraldry that you have found then I have put together some <a href="/resources/identify.html">hints and tips for identification</a>.</p>
