<h1>Mallow</h1>
<p>Mallow: this plant occurs in one coat of arms, perhaps on account of the name: sometimes, however, they are blazoned <a  href="../n/nettle.html">nettle</a> <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a chevron between three sprigs of mallow-leaves argent--MALHERBE.</p>
</blockquote>
