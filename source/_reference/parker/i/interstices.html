<h1>Interstices</h1>
<p>Interstices: a somewhat awkward expression used in cases where awkward arms have to be blazoned, similar to the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, semy of annulets, within each a lion rampant and an eagle displayed alternately sable; in the interstices a lesser annulet of the last--YVAIN.</p>
</blockquote>
