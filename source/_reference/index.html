pageTitle: "Heraldry Reference Material"
---
<p>There is an enormous amount of heraldry and blazonry reference material on the web. In this section I am attempting the near impossible task of bringing order and coherence to at least a part of this vast resource. The effort is two parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To provide a curated, annotated set of links to existing resources</li>
	<li>To provide existing resources in a more accessible form</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide a flavour of what I am proposing, here are examples of each type:</p>

<h2>Annotated Links</h2>

<p>I have searched the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> for useful, out of copyright resources that refer specifically to <a href="bookshelf/index.html">British Heraldry.</a> I intend to use this model to provide similar annotated and organised links to other types of resource.</p>

<h2>Accessible Resources</h2>

<p>Although PDF files are useful, they are not always particularly accessible; there may be OCR errors (if the images have been converted at all), searching is difficult; text in columns can be hard to select and so on. As an example of what can be achieved with native HTML formatted documents I present <a href="parker/index.html">Parker's Dictionary of Heraldry.</a>. For an alternative definition, I have also provided a second dictionary, <a href="elvin/index.html">Elvin's Dictionary of Heraldry.</a> which has many more entries, but each is less detailed.</p>

<p>I also have available another work, <a href="public-arms/index.html">The Book of Public Arms</a>. This is the result of a learning exercise to understand the process of converting scanned PDF documents into more easily accessible web resources. There is also a <a href="public-arms/colophon.html">brief discussion</a></a> of the process to convert this work from the scanned sources to web page format available.</p>

<p>And finally, for now, there is a work-in-progress, an annotated French to English translation of <a href="rietstap/index.html">J.B Rietstap's Armorial Général</a>. The bulk of the front matter has been translated, and is presented in a side-by-side comparison with the original French, and work is underway on the Glossary, <a href="rietstap/a.html">the page for the letter 'A'</a> showing the final intention. Clicking on the image links will bring up a lightbox of the appropriate item. If you would like to help with this translation (or correct anything that I have done so far!) please get in touch.</p>
