<h2>Getting the Shield you want</h2>

<p>Drawshield can be frustrating, the error messages may not seem very helpful and the program keeps crashing! I sympathise (and am working to improve things...) If you are creating your own shield the best approach is to start simple and add one feature a time - start from your field and build from there. If you are trying to draw an existing blazon try putting most of it in brackets - all words in brackets are ignored. DrawShield has particular difficulty with detailed charge descriptions- try commenting out everything except the name of the charge and its tincture, then gradually more of the description one phrase at a time. Also, don't be afraid to e-mail me for advice- see the <a href="/contact/index.html">Contacts Page</a>.</p>

<h2>Colouring Sheets for Kids (or Adults...)</h2>

<p>Go to the <a href="/create/index.html">Create Page</a> and click on options. Tick <strong>Make Printable</strong> and choose <strong>Outline Only</strong> from the <strong>Colourscheme</strong> drop-down. Now enter a blazon (or leave the field empty for a random blazon) and click <strong>Draw Shield!</strong>. A new browser tab will open with a large, page sized shield just ready to be printed and coloured in!</p>

<h2>Share Your Shield</h2>

<p>Have you noticed the caption below your shield on the <a href="/create/index.html">Create Page</a>? This is a live link to your shield design; right click on it and chose "Copy Link Address", then paste into a document, email or social network posting. Clicking on the link will go straight to the DrawShield "Create" page and display your shield.</p>

<h2>Edit Your Shield</h2>

<p>Take a look at the different download formats available under the <strong>Options</strong> on the <a href="/create/index.html">Create Page</a>. PNG can be edited in any graphics editor, like <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/">the Gimp</a> or <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.Net</a>, but for maximum flexibility, without loss of detail download in SVG format and edit with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>.</p>
