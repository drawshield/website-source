<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>One of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, Genoa gets its name from the double-headed Roman God Janus, who can be seen in crest and its arms viz. the Cross of Saint-George from its participation in the Crusades. The Griffins appear with the arms from the 12th century.</q>
