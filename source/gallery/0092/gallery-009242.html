<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Part of six French Renaissance tapestries representing the senses, Le Toucher depicts the sense of touch. The coat of arms seen flying on a banner and born as a shield on the backs of a lion and a unicorn are attributed to Antoine II Le Viste (c. 1470-1534) who is assumed to have commissioned the tapestries.</q>
