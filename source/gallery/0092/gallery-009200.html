<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Salisbury (now called Harare) was the capital of Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe) The wheat sheaves represent agriculture and the fess gold mining. The lion in the crest was adopted from the arms of Rhodes. The motto "Discrimine Salus" means "In Discrimination there is Safety", taken from the motto of the Traill family, from whom Fairbridge was descended, and refers to the careful selection of the site of Salisbury. </q>
