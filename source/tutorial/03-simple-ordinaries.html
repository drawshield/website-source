<p>We have added some interest to our shield by splitting the field into
two but we can do more by adding an <em>ordinary</em>. You can think of
these as "big shapes" that fit across the <em>field</em> (the shield
background, remember?). Ordinaries are usually quite large, obvious
features that always appear in the same position on the shield.
Ordinaries have a colour and, as we saw with divisions earlier, the
colour in blazonry almost always comes AFTER the object.</p>

<img src="img/chevron.png" alt="chevron" class="img-fluid float-md-left" />

<p>Let's look at one example, the <strong>chevron</strong>. We already have
a clue about what it might look like from the previous page, where we
said that <em>per chevron</em> split the shield into two parts by an
inverted 'V' shape. Blazonry is consistent, so we can expect the
<em>chevron</em> ordinary to be something that is also 'V' shaped, and
indeed this is the case. Using some of our newly found colours we can
create the image above. Can you work out what its blazon would
be?</p>


<p>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#blazon1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="blazon1">
          Reveal Answer
        </a>
      </p>
    

      <div class="collapse" id="blazon1">
            <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Recall that the field comes first, in this case, plain white, or
                            <em>argent</em>, then we have a black chevron, so that is a
                            <strong>chevron sable</strong>, giving us another complete blazon:</p>
                            
                            <p><em>Argent, a chevron sable</em></p>
            </div>
        </div>



<p>Note that in this blazon we have a put a in comma in there, which makes it
    easier to say when read outline, but there is no need to do this. In most cases,
as long as the comma is in a sensible place, DrawShield will just ignore it.</p>

<p>We now enough blazonry to start describing shields that we find in the real world. Which of
    the mounted knights below is holding a shield which could be described by the blazon below?

<p><em>Or, a chevron azure</em></p>
