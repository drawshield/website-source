<p>We can add a bit more interest to our shield by splitting the field into
two parts and giving each part a different colour. There are quite a few
ways to split the field into two; they are known as <em>divisions</em>
and each of them has its own special name. Splitting the shield
vertically down the middle is known as <strong>per pale</strong>.
Divisions are always followed by the two colours, so we can already
create a second complete blazon- </p>

<blockquote><em>Per pale gules and azure</em></blockquote>

<p>Which side gets which colour? There is a general rule of blazonry
involved here - things are usually described left to right and top to
bottom. So our blazon above describes a shield that is red
(<em>gules</em>) on the left side and blue (<em>azure</em>) on the
right.</p>

<p>Other common divisions of the field include <strong>per fess</strong>
(split horizontally across the middle), <strong>per bend</strong> (split
diagonally from top left to bottom right) and <strong>per
chevron</strong> (split in an upside down 'V' shape).<p>

<p>There
is a very helpful feature of blazonry - words are always used
consistenly. For example we have seen that <em>per pale</em> means
"split vertically". Wherever the word <em>pale</em> appears we can be
sure that it always has something to with "vertical". For example, if
some things are described as being <strong>in pale</strong> it means
that they are stacked vertically. Similarly, whenever you see the word
<em>fess</em> you will know that relates to something horizontal. Once
you learn a term in blazonry you will know what it means wherever it is
used!</p>

<p>Time for your first practical - try out a few combinations of divisions
and colours in the box here. Remember the division comes first,
followed by two colours. We have some divisions given above but here
is a reminder of some of the colour names for you to experiment with:</p>

<p><strong>sable</strong> (black), <strong>argent</strong> (silver, shown
as white), <strong>or</strong> (gold, shown as yellow), and
<strong>vert</strong> (green).</p>

<p>When you are ready, move on the next page, where we add some more shapes
to our shield.</p>
