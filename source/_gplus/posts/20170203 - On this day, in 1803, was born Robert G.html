<div>On this day, in 1803, was born Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. The arms of the Marquesses of Salisbury are as follows (from Wikipedia):<br/><br/>Quarterly, 1st and 4th, Barry of ten Argent and Azure over all six Escutcheons Sable three two and one each charged with a Lion rampant of the First a Crescent for difference (Cecil); 2nd and 3rd, Argent on a Pale Sable a Conger's Head erased and erect Or charged with an Ermine Spot (Gascoyne)<br/><br/>N.B. I am not seeing the crescent in that achievement.<br/></div>
