<div><b>Heraldry Colouring Book - Free Download
</b><br/><br/>Hello Folks,<br/><br/>If I could beg your indulgence and seek your comments yet again on a recent project! I have put together a "Heraldry Colouring Book", aimed at children that I'm making freely available as a PDF download for printing. I would very much like your feedback on it. I very much enjoyed putting it together and I'm thinking of making a second more "educational" version for kids that will include more information about the names of shapes and charges and so on, and maybe one for adults with a lot more detail. I'd also be grateful if someone could confirm that the version that is "US letter" is indeed that size and prints out OK on that size paper(!)<br/><br/>The book is released under a Creative Commons Licence so please feel free to download and pass on as you see fit.<br/><br/>As always, thanks for your time, and comments greatly appreciated<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>Karl<br/></div>
