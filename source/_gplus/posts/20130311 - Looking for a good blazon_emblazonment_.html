<div>Looking for a good blazon/emblazonment reference book. I prefer English heraldry, but Scottish or French might work as well. Specifically, I'm looking for a book with color (ideally) emblazonments and the blazon directly underneath or next to it so I have something to reference on particularly challenging blazons...</div>
