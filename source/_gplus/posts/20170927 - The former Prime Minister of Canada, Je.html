<div>The former Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chrétien, received his grant of arms recently, and I'm copying the image posted on the CHA's facebook page.<br/><br/>Arms: Gules a beehive Or with three bees Argent embellished Sable, in the canton the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada (four maple leaves conjoined in cross) Argent;<br/>Crest: Issuant from flames Or a phoenix wings elevated and addorsed Azure beaked and crested Gules holding in its beak an open scroll proper; Motto: LABORARE AD ÆDIFICANDUM, meaning “Work to build on”;<br/>Supporters: Two polar bears proper each charged on the shoulder with a Latin cross pendent from each crossbeam two balance pans Gules, standing on a rocky mount proper set with maple leaves Gules and fleurs-de-lis Azure and issuant from barry-wavy Argent and Azure;<br/><br/>What do you think? Personally, I feel like the blazon and drawing doesn't correspond with each other, and that it leaves too much freedom to the artist on how to draw those bees.<br/><br/></div>
