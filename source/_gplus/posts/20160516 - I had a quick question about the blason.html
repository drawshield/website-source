<div>I had a quick question about the blasoning of flags, especially where the cross is off-center, like in Sweden's case.<br/><br/>I'd be tempted to blazon it 'Azure a cross Or', but heraldic crosses are typically centered (except on the very long triangular shields of yore).<br/>So how would you call this?</div>
