<div>New Resource - Web version of Elvin's Heraldic Dictionary<br/><br/>* 6,000*  Entries, 46 Plates, 2,500 figures<br/>* Searchable entries or browse alphabetically<br/>* Hand-corrected OCR text<br/>* API available for remote access<br/>* Free to use, no advertisements<br/>* Author seeks coffee, cake, comments and corrections<br/>* <a href="https://drawshield.net/reference/elvin/index.html">https://drawshield.net/reference/elvin/index.html
</a><br/><br/>I am very pleased to announce a new addition to the Drawshield.net reference section - "Elvin's Heraldic Dictionary". This complements the existing Parker's Dictionary as it has more than twice as many entries, albeit with slightly briefer definitions. You can read the web based version at the above address.<br/><br/>In addition, I am also pleased to announce a "Beta" version of a programming API which allows you to build in heraldic dictionary search into your own applications. The Drawshield.net Reference API gives you access to quick definitions for 8,500 terms from Parker's and Elvin's dictionaries. You can search either or both dictionaries using either exact or "fuzzy" match search criteria, with the definition returned in an easy to use JSON format. The API is documented at <a href="https://drawshield.net/resources/reference-api.html">https://drawshield.net/resources/reference-api.html
</a><br/><br/>I hope these resources are useful. Suggestions for other (out of copyright) works that might be useful are welcome.<br/><br/>Best regards to all,<br/><br/>Karl<br/></div>
