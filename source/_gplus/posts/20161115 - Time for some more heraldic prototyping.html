<div>Time for some more heraldic prototyping :) I would really like your help to draw this, once again.<br/><br/>After some more thinking, I have been considering the following blazon for my (mother's) arms:<br/><br/>Per fesse dancetty Azure and Argent, four cubit arms crosswise conjoined , issuant from the chief, a demi sun in splendour charged with an open book, all counterchanged.<br/><br/>An alternative reading:<br/>Per fesse dancetty Azure and Argent, a cross with a hand  at each end, issuant from the chief, a demi sun in splendour charged with an open book, all counterchanged.<br/><br/></div>
