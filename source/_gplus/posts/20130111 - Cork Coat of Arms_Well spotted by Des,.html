<div><b>Cork Coat of Arms
</b><br/><br/>Well spotted by Des, although not in a traditional shield shape, and inconveniently high up, these are indeed the arms attributed to the Irish City of Cork:<br/><br/><i>CORK, City of (Co. Cork). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. Those attributed to the city and generally used are - Or, on waves of the sea a ship of three masts in full sail proper, between two towers gules, upon rocks, also proper. Motto - " Statio bene fide carinis." Burke, in his " General Armory," blazons the coat " Or, an ancient ship between two castles in fesse gules."

</b>, P.208)</div>
