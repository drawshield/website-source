<div><b>Merchant Tailors Arms, Bristol, England
</b><br/><br/>I was put on to this magnificent image by the story here - <a href="http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Magnificent-coat-arms-Merchant-Tailors/story-18322782-detail/story.html#axzz2MhbJRz58">http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Magnificent-coat-arms-Merchant-Tailors/story-18322782-detail/story.html#axzz2MhbJRz58
</a> (will someone please them they are allowed to put more than one sentence in a paragraph...)<br/><br/>You can see the entrance they talk about in Street View here:Â <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/n3l5w">http://goo.gl/maps/n3l5w
</a> and the full blazon, from Fox-Davies <b>Book of Public Arms
</b> (P 506) is:<br/><br/><i>MERCHANT TAYLORS, The Worshipful Company of, "London. (Incor-porated loth March 1326.) Argent, a Tent Royal between two Parliament robes purpure, lined ermine, the tent garnished or, tent-staff, of the la'st, on a chief azure, a lion passant guardant or. Crest - On a wreath of the colours, a 'mount vert, thereon a lamb passant argent, all within a glory or. Supporters - Two camels or. Motto - " Concordia parvse res crescunt." '
</i><br/><br/><i>[Arms granted by Sir Thomas Holme, 1480 ; confirmed by Sir Thomas Wriothesley, 1530 ; crest and supporters granted by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux, 23rd December 1586. Grants printed "Memorials of the Guild of Merchant Taylors." The blazon in the original grant is : " Argent, a pavillion with two mantles imperial purple garnished with gold, on a chief azure, a lion passant or" ; but the lion is certainly painted as "passant guardant."]
