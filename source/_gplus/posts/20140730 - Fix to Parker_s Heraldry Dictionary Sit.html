<div><b>Fix to Parker's Heraldry Dictionary Site
</b><br/><br/>I'm kind of embarrassed how long it has taken me to fix this, but I have at last sorted out the <i>Cross
</i> entry in Parker's Heraldic dictionary ( <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/parker/c/cross">http://karlwilcox.com/parker/c/cross
</a> ) so that the links to the individual types of cross now work correctly. There may be a few places where links are still broken, if you find any please let me know.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking about doing a similar conversion job on another major Heraldic work, possibly WIlliam Berry's <b>Encyclopaedia Heraldica
</b> from the early 19th Century, either as a separate site, or maybe combined with Parker's. I'm open to suggestions...</div>
