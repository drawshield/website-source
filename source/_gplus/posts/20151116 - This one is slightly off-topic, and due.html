<div>This one is <i>slightly
</i> off-topic, and due to my reading of The Curiosities of Heraldry by Mark Antony Lower.<br/><br/>In it, Lower invests a sizeable portion about the little-known title of Esquire.<br/><br/>Wikipedia has an article about it, and the best summary of it is that authorities have some disagreements about it.<br/><br/>Does anybody know if there are more recent analyses on the matter? Especially, what are the rationales between the choices (like, why Masters of Arts and Bachelors of Law and Physic are entitled to it, but not graduates of other fields)<br/><br/>(link to Lower: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38951">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38951
