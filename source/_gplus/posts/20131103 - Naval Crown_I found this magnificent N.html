<div><b>Naval Crown
</b><br/><br/>I found this magnificent Naval Crown while taking photos for my "Heraldry of Lincoln Cathedral" project. I can't use it for that project as I'm only considering complete shields but this was just too nice not to use somewhere! It is in the Seaman's Chapel of the cathedral and is made of enamelled metal, about 12" across.<br/><br/>The naval crown was allegedly first used by the Roman navy, awarded to the first man to board an enemy vessel. I suspect this is actually a medieval invention as none of the books I have read can actually  provide a reference to a contemporaneous Roman source...</div>
