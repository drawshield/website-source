<div><b>Heraldry in the Attic
</b><br/><br/>The headline says it all here. We can see at a glance that this is an ancient coat of arms because it is <i>dimidiated
</i> - that is, two existing arms have simply been cut in half and con-joined. This is a very early form of linking arms and quite rapidly went out of fashion as in many cases it didn't really work, or produced oddities such as these fish tailed Lions. <br/><br/>See <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/parker/m/Marshalling">http://karlwilcox.com/parker/m/Marshalling
