<div><b>What Would You Like From This Community?
</b><br/><br/>Hello folks,<br/><br/>The heraldry community is a few weeks old now, so I thought this was a good time to reflect on what we would like out of this community. I am quite happy to continue running things as they are more or less indefinitely , for reasons I will go into below, but it would also be good to find out your own views.<br/><br/>I started the community because I have a genuine interest in heraldry and find the whole subject absolutely fascinating; I do however have an ulterior motive. Over the last few years I have taken a career break to help raise our children two of whom, I hope, will soon be going off to college! I will need to re-enter the world of work and I'm hoping to resume my university teaching career. In my spare time, I have worked on a variety of projects that I've grouped together into a new discipline I have called <b>Computational Heraldry
</b>, which I define as <i>the Application of Information Technology to the Study, Creation and Recording of Heraldry
</i>. The Google+ Heraldry Community is part of this and whole creation is something I can hopefully use to interest both Computer Science and History faculties!<br/><br/>This should not however be all about my needs, but what others might like to see. Here are a few potential ideas:<br/><br/>> I would like to add an FAQ section, do you think this is a good idea?<br/><br/>> The community currently concentrates on British heraldry, because that's all I know! Should we seek those with knowledge of other Heraldric traditions?<br/><br/>> Should we seek to increase the membership? I could for example, post in the Google + genealogy communities, who's members have at least a peripheral interest in heraldry. I have already posted in the SCA Heraldry community (although they are more concerned with their wider roles as SCA Heralds, rather than straight-forward blazonry)<br/><br/>> What else would people like to see? Please let me know!<br/><br/>Happy holidays and my very best wishes to you all, <br/>Karl <br/>Founder and Moderator, G+ Heraldry Community</div>
