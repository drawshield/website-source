<div>Another question for the community, this time for the more scholarly-minded.<br/><br/>Can you list the traditions that exist regarding additaments? Here is what I can recall:<br/>- Heralds / Kings of Arms get batons behind the shield<br/>- Helm according to rank (+ chapeau / coronet if applicable)<br/>- Clergy get an ecclesial hat / mitre (and possibly a staff)  instead of the helm<br/>- Circlets (or Maltese Cross) if a member of the given order (e.g. Garter, Canada)<br/>- Medals galore, as long as they're officially recognized<br/>- Anything else?<br/><br/>I haven't noticed a tradition for scholars though. For instance, no academic robe instead of the mantling.</div>
