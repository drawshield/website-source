<div><b>Just because you have the same name...
</b><br/><br/>I make a big point of reminding folks that having the same name as an armigerous person (i.e. someone who has a coat of arms) does <b>not
</b> mean that you too are entitled to use the same arms. Well this story illustrates that the same applies to corporate bodies...<br/><br/>In short, a coat of arms was issued to an English Borough (A bit like a US county), and during a later administrative reorganisation, the Borough ceased to exist. The coat of arms however continued to be used by the largest town, which happened to have the same name as the old borough. They have now been told that this is incorrect, but never fear, moves are afoot to right this dreadful wrong!</div>
