<div>The major city in the Eastern Townships is Sherbrooke, which assumed arms a while back.<br/><br/>They explain the rationale on their website, but not its blazon.<br/><br/>My guess:<br/><br/>Arms: Or, a pall wavy Azure charged with two lightning bolts in chief, a mullet of six points Argent voided of the charge at the heart point and a lance head Or in base between in chief a rose Gules and two fleur-de-lys Azure in base.<br/>Coronet: a mural coronet of seven towers Or masoned Sable<br/>Supporters: a weart of palm leaves vert<br/>Motto: « Ne quid nimis », meaning  « Nothing too much »<br/><br/>Anybody can do better? I'm loosing my edge :$<br/><br/>What do you think of it? I personally feel it is overloaded, trying to say too many things.</div>
