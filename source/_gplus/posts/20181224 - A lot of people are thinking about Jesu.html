<div>A lot of people are thinking about Jesus nowadays,  for some reason ;)<br/><br/>So lets get our creativity... imagine what his coat of arms should be... no need to stick to tradition.<br/><br/>My humble contribution: "Argent, a label Azure".<br/>Why? "God is light; in him there is no darkness at all." (1John 1:5), hence the crisp white field. The label is for obvious reasons. I picked Azure because of rule of tinctures and because I like blue.<br/><br/>(Drawshield has a bug and renders the label Gules it seems)</div>
