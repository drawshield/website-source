<div>Counter-changing can be tricky. A perfect example is the 'Union Jack' - which ends up being asymmetric. The reasons for this is lost to history.<br/><br/>azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter charged argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent]<br/><br/>I would've preferred a symmetric arrangement like Azure, a saltire conjoined to a cross Gules, all fimbriated Argent.<br/></div>
