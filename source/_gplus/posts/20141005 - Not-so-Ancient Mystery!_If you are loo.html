<div><b>Not-so-Ancient Mystery!
</b><br/><br/>If you are looking for something from before the second world war, or after the turn of the century then the internet almost certainly has it somewhere. The post-war years up to the internet age are something of a "black hole" as so much is still in copyright, hence the award of a knighthood just 50 years ago becomes a "mystery"!</div>
