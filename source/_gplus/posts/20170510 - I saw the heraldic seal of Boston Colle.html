<div>I saw the heraldic seal of Boston College in the news lately, so I'm sharing.<br/><br/>Plus, they actually remember the meaning:<br/>"The Boston College seal is the official logo of the university. The current seal has been in use since 1934. At its center is a shield that contains the seal's major elements: two crowns and a badge, a book and three mountains. The crowns are derived from the three crowns in the coat of arms of Boston, England, for which Boston, Massachusetts is named. In the BC seal, two crowns are used, with the traditional badge of the Society of Jesus replacing the third crown. Below the crowns is an open book.<br/><br/>Boston College's motto, "ever to excel," is written in Greek on the pages of the open book. The three mountains are the "trimount," which comes from Tremont, the early name for Boston. Below the shield, a scroll appears inscribed with the Latin words "Religioni et Bonis Artibus." The outside ring of the seal includes the name of the university in Latin and the date of its founding, 1863."<br/><a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/pubaf/about/faq.html">http://www.bc.edu/offices/pubaf/about/faq.html
