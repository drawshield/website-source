<div>Happy belated birthday to Margrethe II, Queen of Denmark (b. 16 April 1940). Her arms are as follows.<br/><br/>Escutcheon 	A shield quartered by a cross Argent fimbriated Gules, first and fourth quarter Or, three lions passant in pale Azure crowned and armed Or langued Gules, nine lilypads Gules (for Denmark); second quarter Or, two lions passant in pale Azure armed Or langued Gules (for Schleswig); third quarter Azure, party per fess, in base per pale; in chief three crowns Or (for the Kalmar Union), in dexter base a ram passant Argent armed and unguled Or (for the Faroe Islands), in sinister base a polar bear rampant Argent (for Greenland). Overall an escutcheon Or two bars Gules (for Oldenburg)<br/>Supporters 	two wild men armed with clubs Proper<br/>Compartment 	pedestal<br/>Motto 	Latin: Magnanimi Pretium<br/><br/>The achievement is crowned with the Crown of King Christian V and mantled gules lined Ermine. Around the shield are the collars of the Order of the Dannebrog, and Order of the Elephant<br/><br/>You probably noticed that things got a little complicated in the 3rd quarter. I'm not sure why they haven't leveraged the redundant 4th quarter or used a simpler blazon. I suppose that devoting an entire quarter to something that looks a bit like the arms of Sweden has something to do with it.</div>
