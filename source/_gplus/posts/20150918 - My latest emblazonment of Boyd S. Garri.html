<div>My latest emblazonment of Boyd S. Garrison's (my dad's) assumed arms (in 2011). This rendering done for submission to publication of Vol. II of "The Armorial Register - International Register of arms"<br/><br/>It was a bit rushed because my dad's arms were the very last entry and I had literally 12 hours to complete the painting, lol. There are problems with it, but overall I'm satisfied (just don't look at it through a microscope!)</div>
