<div>An interesting feature of the arms granted to the Hudson Bay Company is a Cap of Maintenance. It used to be reserved for barons in the days of feudal tenure.<br/><br/>I could not find an explanation for it, but I postulate that it had to do with the fact that the Company was in charge of large parts of (mostly unsettled)  Canada at the time. I suppose that this situation made it a tenant in capite of Crown land.</div>
