<div>Has anybody here been refused a grant or registration of arms, or know somebody who has? If reasons were given for the refusal, what were they? What factors do you think increase the chance of being granted arms, especially in the British systems?<br/><br/>Especially interested in information about the Canadian Heraldic Authority's refusals.</div>
