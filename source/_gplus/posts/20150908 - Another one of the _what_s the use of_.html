<div>Another one of the 'what's the use of?' questions.<br/><br/>In pretty much every write-up I saw on heraldic badges, they are described as some way to identify servants, soldiers and possessions, etc..<br/><br/>Yet I'm seeing a few grants of badges in the Canadian register to individuals, and I'm doubtful that all the fellows who got one live like in Downton Abbey.<br/><br/>Badges for the military folks and law enforcement agencies are pretty obvious. I'd say the same thing for private schools and sports team. But for John Doe?</div>
