<div><b>The James Stuart Garden
</b><br/><br/>As I wandered the back streets of Norwich the other day (don't ask why) I came across this rather splendid gateway to a small public garden just south of the Cathedral. You can see it on Google Street View here:  <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/28JyU">http://goo.gl/maps/28JyU
</a><br/><br/>At first glance you might assume that these are the Stuart arms, but as the as the local registry of sculpture notes ( <a href="http://www.racns.co.uk/sculptures.asp?action=getsurvey&id=573">http://www.racns.co.uk/sculptures.asp?action=getsurvey&id=573
</a> ), it is only "based on" the Stuart Arms. The <i>pelican in her piety
</i> on the crest is correct, as is the motto <i>Virescit vulnere virtus
</i> but the rest is rather fanciful as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>The James Stuart in question was a proponent of wider education, and of women's suffrage, but does not appear to have borne arms, and neither did his father, a Scottish Mill Owner. Interestingly, his father-in-law David Booth was also Scottish and was noted for being a slightly wacky lexicographer and publisher for the marvellously named <i>Society for the Diffussion of Useful Knowledge
</i> (SDUK).<br/><br/>James Stuart's wife was a member of the Norwich Colman family (famous for their mustard), and although the gateway was her bequest she does not seem to be source of the arms either.<br/><br/>The carving is a little worn, but the blazon would be appear to be something like: <i>(field), a fess, in chief a woman's(?) head between two roses, in base a roundel charge with a saltire
</i> (I think, if you look really closely!)<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't explain the origin properly but it is a nice find...</div>
