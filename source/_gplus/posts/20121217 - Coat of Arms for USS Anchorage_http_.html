</a><br/><br/>Nice arms here, seems to be much excitement about the moose antlers (must be an Alaskan thing... didn't a moose feature a lot in <i>Northern Exposure
</i>...?) Anyway, the USS Anchorage is a newly launched San Antonio Class "Amphibious Transport Dock" (which looks a lot cooler than it sounds), to be based in San Diego.<br/><br/>Very cool arms folks - my best wishes and good luck to all who sail and serve in her.</div>
