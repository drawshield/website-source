<div><b>New Coat of Arms for Nailsea Air Cadets
</b><br/><br/>Nailsea is a small town near the Bristol Channel, in the West of England. Their air cadet squadron has a newly granted coat of arms. Military arms and crests can tend to be over-complex, but I quite like this nice, clean example. The two objects "in saltire" are glass blower's orbs.<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23heraldry/posts">#heraldry
