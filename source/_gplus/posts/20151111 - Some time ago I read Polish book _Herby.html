<div>Some time ago I read Polish book "Herby, legendy, dawne mity" ("Coats of arms, legends, old myths"). I was disgusted by the illustrations. Desription of my favourite Łada and its illustration were different :( and the illustrations didn't have colours. Also shape of escutcheons was strange. I don't have this book now but I draw some coats of arms from it and posted on blog. Have you ever seen such type of escutcheon? <br/><a href="http://dzikadusza9.blogspot.com/2015/05/herby.html">http://dzikadusza9.blogspot.com/2015/05/herby.html
