<div><b>Stained Glass Heraldry...but NOT in a Church!
</b><br/><br/>I was given a great book on the London Underground(+) for Christmas and that lead to reading all things metropolitan transit related. This site was a fascinating read and revealed some absolutely beautiful stained glass shields in a quite unexpected place...<br/><br/>(+) And a bonus point for anyone who can name the film in which it was said "And the London Underground is not a political movement..."</div>
