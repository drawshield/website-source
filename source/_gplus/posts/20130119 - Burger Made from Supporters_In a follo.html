<div><b>Burger Made from Supporters
</b><br/><br/>In a follow-up to our previous Australia story, here is a burger specially blended from the supporting creatures! I love the idea that they tried to create a "live action" coat of arms, but kangaroos and emus don't get on...<br/><br/>Of course, if we tried this in the UK we would need a reliable source of Unicorn meat...</div>
