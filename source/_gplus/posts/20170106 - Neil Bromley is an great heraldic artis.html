<div>Neil Bromley is an great heraldic artist with a lot of beautiful samples on his website.<br/><br/>Here is what he did for a Canadian grant. Just wow.<br/>Normally, Canadian Letters Patent aren't that pretty. Looks like this grantee wanted something on his wall that attracted attention!<br/><br/>[EDIT]<br/>Note that the actual grant document is available in the CHA Register: <a href="http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=2756&ProjectImageID=3951">http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=2756&ProjectImageID=3951
</a><br/><br/>The difference is not only the sobre look. The words are not the same either.<br/></div>
