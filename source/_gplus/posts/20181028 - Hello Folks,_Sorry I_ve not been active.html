<div>Hello Folks,<br/>Sorry I've not been active for a while but I have not been idle - I have written a new, much improved random blazon generator to be found at <a href="https://drawshield.net/random/">https://drawshield.net/random/
</a> which I invite you try out. It isn't quite finished yet and does not appear in the site navigation menus yet but the advantages are:<br/>- Better choice of colours to avoid e.g. argent alongside ermine<br/>- Broader coverage of drawshield features<br/>- Massively tunable! Lots of options...<br/>- Neatly formatted blazons<br/>- API Available (see below)<br/>As well as the web page linked above, you can now for the first time also call up a random blazon through an API - this is fully documented at <a href="https://github.com/karlwilcox/Drawshield-Code/wiki/The-RandomBlazon-API">https://github.com/karlwilcox/Drawshield-Code/wiki/The-RandomBlazon-API
</a> . The precise details of the arguments might change a bit but I won't be changing the endpoint URL so please feel to integrate it in other things if you want to.<br/>Comments, corrections and suggestions are very welcome.<br/>I hope this is useful to you,<br/>All the best,<br/>Karl</div>
