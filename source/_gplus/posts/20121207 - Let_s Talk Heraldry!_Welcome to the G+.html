<div><b>Let's Talk Heraldry!
</b><br/><br/>Welcome to the G+ Heraldry Community! We are here to find, talk about, create and educate on all aspects of heraldry. This is a fun community for anyone interested in any aspect of heraldry and we welcome anyone, of any skill level or background.<br/><br/>We have a forum for general <b>discussion
</b> and questions about heraldry. If you have created your own artwork please put a sample in our <b>Heraldry Artwork
</b> forum to get some polite and helpful feedback. If you are out and about with your camera and find some heraldry please post your images in <b>Heraldry Photos
</b>, we may be able to help you find out more about it. And if you know about books, websites, museums or even people that are good for Heraldry knowledge please let us know in the <b>Heraldry Resources
</b> forum.<br/><br/>Please post any suggestions, comments etc. to the discussion forum. Ideas and volunteers are always welcome.<br/><br/>Best regards to you all,<br/><br/>Karl</div>
