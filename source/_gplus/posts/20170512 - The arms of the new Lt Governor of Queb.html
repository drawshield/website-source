<div>The arms of the new Lt Governor of Quebec, Michel Doyon. Interestingly, the differencing for his childrens' arms are on the partition line of the chief. That's the first time I see this kind of differencing.<br/><br/>Also, there is no viceregal crown here, though he could've legitimately get it granted if he wanted to.</div>
