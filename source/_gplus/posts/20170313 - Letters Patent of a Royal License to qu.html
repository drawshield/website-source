<div>Letters Patent of a Royal License to quarter inherited arms.<br/><br/>In the UK, it was common to have an 'name and arms' clause to a Will - whereby someone would inherit something on condition that they took the deceased's arms and last name.<br/><br/>But since that went beyond the terms of the original Letters Patent, somebody's permission was needed.<br/><br/>For some reason, that goes beyond the scope of the Earl Marshal's mandate. So the prerogative was kept by the Sovereign in England.<br/><br/>Which means that the Kings and Queens have had to sign official papers allowing this on a regular basis for centuries. Once that is done, the College of Arms issues a new Letters Patent following that fact.<br/><br/>AFAIK, Lyon handles the full Royal Prerogative in Scotland, so the Sovereign isn't involved. As for Canada, I'm not aware of a case like that yet, but I'd expect this to be handled by the Governor General, since he's been delegated the full Royal powers on armorial matters.</div>
