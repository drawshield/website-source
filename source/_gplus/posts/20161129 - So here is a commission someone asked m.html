<div>So here is a commission someone asked me to do in a Kamon style. He wanted a mix of European and Kamon styles so this is what I came up with. Obviously this wouldn't fly with any heraldic college, but as an exercise I would like to see how you would blazon it. <br/><br/>Here is what I have:<br/><br/>Quarterly Or and Gules, 1st a Torch Gules, 2nd a Book debruised by a Quill Or, 3rd & 4th a Scale Counterchanged. All surrounded by a bordure saltire Purpure with each quarter containing 7 Roundels Argent. Supporters 2 Bald Eagles respectant and the motto Tempus Breve Est (Time Is Short) to be carried in an escroll beneath.</div>
