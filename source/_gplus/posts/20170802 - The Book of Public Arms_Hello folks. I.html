<div><b>The Book of Public Arms
</b><br/><br/>Hello folks. I have been working on a new version of the <a href="http://drawshield.net">drawshield.net
</a> website with the aim to add much more heraldry reference material. As a first step I have created a web version of <b>The Book of Public Arms
</b> by A.C.Fox-Davies. This includes 2,500+ entries of municipal, royal and corporate arms; each on its own page, with all of the 1,300+ illustrations on the appropriate page, cross-references turned into proper links and including a full alphabetical index of all the entries. (A search mechanism will be added soon). You can find the book here: <a href="http://drawshield.net/reference/public-arms/index.html">http://drawshield.net/reference/public-arms/index.html
</a> <br/><br/>The pages were created using the scanned versions of the original physical books available from the internet archive, using a number of custom written utilities and a <i>lot
</i> of image cutting and pasting(!).<br/><br/>This will hopefully be the first of a number of out-of-copyright works that I would like to add. Comments, corrections and suggestions for any books to tackle next are welcome.</div>
