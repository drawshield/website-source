<div><b>Hats Off to "Sodacan"
</b><br/><br/>The Wikimedia Commons pages are a fantastic resource of over 15 million media files. There is a very rich set of heraldic images, many of them produced by the user "Sodacan" (not, I suspect, their real name). Sodacan's images (like that of Princess Maud of Wales show below) are produced using Inkscape, in the SVG format and are freely available - I have re-used many of them (with appropriate credits) in my drawshield program. I am totally in awe of the superb quality of these images (see them all atÂ <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sodacan">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sodacan
</a>).<br/><br/>Sodacan, I salute you!</div>
