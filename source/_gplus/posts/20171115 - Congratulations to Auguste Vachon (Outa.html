<div>Congratulations to Auguste Vachon (Outaouais Herald Emeritus) for his appointment as Académicien of the Académie internationale d’héraldique (International Academy of Heraldry)<br/><br/>His arms are the following.<br/><br/>Please note that this is an interesting case of an atypical grant of supporters. In this case, it was not because of the position or rank held by Mr. Vachon, but because of extraordinary services rendered to the Crown. The Warrant and Letters Patent was signed by the Governor General herself.<br/><br/><a href="http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=212&ShowAll=1">http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=212&ShowAll=1
