The Mothers’ Union presented this banner, designed by J Ninian Comper, on 22nd June 1926. Made from blue and gold brocaded silk damask, it’s embroidered in silks with a circle of white, edged with gold. Within this, you can see Christ holding a cross, standing on a green mound at the head of a flock of sheep, with St Peter kneeling for blessing in front."/><p>Banner of St Peter - Westminster Abbey
