</b><b> on a Coat of Arms?
</b><br/><br/>Well, not actually a Coat of Arms yet, but a proposal to design one for a Canadian County. I really hope they don't go for the Oil Refinery theme...<br/><br/>Then again, when I looked at this page from the local news it had the current weather, which read "Sunny, -11c" which just seems sooo cold to a soft, temperate Brit like me!</div>
