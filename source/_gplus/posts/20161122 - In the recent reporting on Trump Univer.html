<div>In the recent reporting on Trump University, I got to see their color logo/arms. Those are almost heraldic for a change!<br/><br/>Quaterly Gules and Or, a lion rampant Sable; in chief two chevronels of the  same; within a bordure Or<br/><br/>There is one tiny thing in this achievement though - the lion is all Sable, whereas they are typically going to be langued and armed Gules.<br/>Is there a way to blazon that?</div>
