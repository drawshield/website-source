<div>I am glad to report that Heraldry is alive and well in Austria - at least the civic heraldry.<br/><br/>One big feature is that the coat of arms of the regions are visible on all the license plates. Basically, the arms of the region where you register your car is on your license plate - thus making it a little bit harder to live a double life ;)</div>
