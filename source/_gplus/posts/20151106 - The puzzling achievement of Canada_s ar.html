<div>The puzzling achievement of Canada's arms.<br/><br/>I'm linking to a page within the site of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada that has all its history.<br/><br/>One thing that puzzles me is how the achievement renders the blazon, and that means there's something I have to learn! I'm skipping the supporters because they are not relevant to the questions I have.<br/><br/>1) The arms are supposed to be tierced in fess, yet the third fess takes roughly half of the field, though it used to be 1/3rds in the 1923 achievement.<br/>2) The maple leaves in base are Proper, and the one in the crest is Gules. And yet their look the same. In the 1923 achivement, Proper = Vert. How come??? And why not normalize the blazon then?<br/><br/>Arms:	Tierced in fess: the first two divisions containing the quarterly coat following, namely, 1st Gules three lions passant guardant in pale or, 2nd, Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules, 3rd, Azure a harp or stringed Argent, 4th, Azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or, and the third division Argent three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper.<br/>Crest:	Upon a Royal helmet mantled argent doubled Gules the Crest, that is to say, On a wreath of the colours Argent and Gules a lion passant guardant or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf Gules.</div>
