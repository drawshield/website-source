<div>Hello Folks, if you have a moment I would appreciate your feedback on a new poster that I have created to help raise funds for further Drawshield.net development. It is available on Zazzle, just search for Drawshield, or see the link below. I really enjoyed putting this together and might make it the first of a series (Guide to Charges... Guide to Marshalling... etc???). Anyway, all comments welcome! Thank you for you time,<br/>Karl</div>
