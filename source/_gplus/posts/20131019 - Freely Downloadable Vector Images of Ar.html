<div><b>Freely Downloadable Vector Images of Arms
</b><br/><br/>The <b>Brands of the World
</b> website has some very nice, good quality coat of arms images. There is a category for "Heraldry" which contains over a thousand images. There is also a free text search by title.<br/><br/>Downloads are in a variety of formats, most seem to be .eps (encapsulated postscript) but I've also seen .ai (Adobe Illustrator) and .cdr (Corel Draw) amongst others. Gimp and Inkscape can open most of these, although Inkscape seems to need Ghostscript installed to read the .eps files.<br/><br/>Note that "freely downloadable" does not mean "freely usuable". Copyright remains with the original owner and also of course, use of some heraldic images is restricted by laws in addition to copyrights.<br/><br/>Overall, a potentially useful and high quality resource. </div>
