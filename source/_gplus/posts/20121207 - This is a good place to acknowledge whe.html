<div>This is a good place to acknowledge where I first learnt heraldry -Â <a href="http://heraldry.sca.org/primer/index.html">http://heraldry.sca.org/primer/index.html
</a> - in fact my first aim with the drawshield program was to implement everything in this primer. So just to say "thanks" to all those who put the primer together and a recommendation for anyone looking for a great introduction to blazonry.</div>
