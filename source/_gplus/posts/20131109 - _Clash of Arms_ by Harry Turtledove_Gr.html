<div><b>"Clash of Arms" by Harry Turtledove
</b><br/><br/>Great narrated short story here! One of my other interests is Science Fiction and I greatly enjoy the "Starship Sofa" podcast by <span><span>+

</span>Â Tony has more time to record these than I have to listen to them as I'm still back on episode 300, which included a series of short stories by Harry Turtledove. Give "Clash of Arms" a listen (30 minutes in, 21 minutes long) for a cautionary tale on the perils of bragging about our blazonry skills! Well worth a listen, and to test your knowledge against - better still subscribe and listen to the whole show!</div>
