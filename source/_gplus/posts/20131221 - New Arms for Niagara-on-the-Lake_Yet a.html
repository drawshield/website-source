<div><b>New Arms for Niagara-on-the-Lake
</b><br/><br/>Yet another small Canadian town has new arms. Apparently known as NotL to its friends and inhabitants, Niagra-on-the-Lake has some rather nice new arms.<br/><br/> (Warning - link has a deeply annoying auto-playing video ad - the story is also reported here: <a href="http://www.niagaraadvance.ca/2013/12/12/town-unveils-new-flag-coat-of-arms">http://www.niagaraadvance.ca/2013/12/12/town-unveils-new-flag-coat-of-arms
</a> but the pictures are not as good!)</div>
