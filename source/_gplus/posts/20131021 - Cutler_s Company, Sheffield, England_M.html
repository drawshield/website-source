<div><b>Cutler's Company, Sheffield, England
</b><br/><br/>My son has just started a maths degree at Sheffield Hallam University and one of the early faculty meetings was in "Cutler's Hall", so I helped him search it out, to find these arms prominently displayed. Apologies for the dreadful image quality, you can see it a little better in streetview, here: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ojhpC">http://goo.gl/maps/ojhpC
</a> <br/><br/>The city of Sheffield is famous for its fine steel cutlery, a heritage reflected in the name of its Ice Hockey team ("Steelers") and the nickname of its soccer team ("Blades"). The guild of Cutler's have arms recorded in Fox-Davies <b>Book of Public Arms
</b>, P222-3:<br/><br/><i>CUTLERS' COMPANY (Sheffield). (Incorporated by Act of Parliament, 24 Jas. I., c. 31.) Argent, on a fess indented vert, between three pairs of swords in saltire proper, pommels and hilts sable, eight arrows interlaced saltirewise banded of the field between two garbs or. Crest—On a wreath of the colours, in front of an elephant's head couped or, two swords in saltire as in the arms. Motto—" Pour y parvenir a bon foi." [Granted College of Arms.]
</i><br/><br/>I'm hoping to visit him on Friday and maybe get some better pictures!</div>
