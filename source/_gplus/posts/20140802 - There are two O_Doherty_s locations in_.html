<div>There are two O'Doherty's locations in Spokane. One is downtown and this one is on the north side. This is an example I think of co-opting arms without realizing that sharing a surname doesn't immediately authorize use of another's arms. Still, it's nice to see such a bold display of arms in an American city.</div>
