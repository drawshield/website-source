<div><b>Announcing - 
</b><b><a href="http://drawshield.net">drawshield.net
</a>
</b><b> and Drawshield3 pre-alpha
</b><br/><br/>Hi Folks! Drawshield has a new home! Or at least a new name for its existing home...<br/><br/>I must be doing something right because someone has "cybersquatted" <a href="http://drawshield.com">drawshield.com
</a>! I always felt .net was more appropriate anyway, so that's what it is. At the moment it just redirects to <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/drawshield">karlwilcox.com/drawshield
</a> (which will still be available). I would like it to be a stand-alone domain but I need to do some more research about how to do that.<br/><br/>If you visit <a href="http://drawshield.net">drawshield.net
</a> you will see a new tab down the side of the book, titled <b>Analyse
</b>. This is a back-door into a very early version of drawshield3 - don't get too excited it doesn't draw anything yet, just does some analysis of the blazon. There are a lot of new features planned and I don't want to clutter up this community so over the next few days I'll be tidying up the drawshield google+ page (atÂ <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110593577831754313389/110593577831754313389/posts">https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110593577831754313389/110593577831754313389/posts
</a> ) and posting all the new information there.<br/><br/>Watch that space!<br/><br/>Thanks all,<br/>Karl</div>
