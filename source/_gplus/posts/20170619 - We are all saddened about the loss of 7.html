<div>We are all saddened about the loss of 79+ lives in Grenfell Tower in London, which is located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Here are the arms of that borough.<br/><br/>The blazon is not specified, so here is what I'm guessing.<br/><br/>Arms: Gules, a mitre Or; on a chief Ermine three Ducal coronets Or<br/>Crest: A broom plant Proper<br/>Supporters: on the dexter, a boar Sable langued Gules and tusked Or; on the sinister winged bull Argent hooved and armed Or<br/>Compartment: a hill Vert<br/>Motto: Quam Bonum in Unum Habitare, which means 'What a good thing it is to dwell in unity'.</div>
