<div>There was a shooting 10 years ago (on 13 Sept) in Dawson College, Wesmount, Quebec, Canada. That college is not armigerous as far as I can tell, but here are the arms of Wesmount.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, they were granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1945.<br/><br/>Arms: Per fess enarched Or and Purpure, issuant from chief a demi-sun in his splendour Argent rayed Gules, in base a rose branch fesswise, slipped at each end and leaved proper bearing two roses Argent and pendant from the middle of the branch an escutcheon Argent charged with the raven of Saint Anthony volant and bringing bread all proper<br/>Coronet: A mural coronet of three towers proper; <br/>Motto:  ROBUR MEUM CIVIUM FIDES, meaning “The faith of the citizen is my strength.”</div>
