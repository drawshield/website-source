<div><b>Heraldic Devices for a Cyber-Security Consultant?
</b><br/><br/>Question from a correspondent:<br/><br/>"Â I am designing a device for my husband. His previous career in the profession of arms presents no problem. He's now moved into cyber-security. Have you any suggestion for a heraldic representation? I considered the lightning bolt, as representative of electronics, but it has unfortunate associations that are still within living memory. I am considering a spider-in-web that I found in a 15th century emblem book, but I'm not entirely satisfied. I should be grateful for any suggestions you or your group may have. "<br/><br/>I'll open the floor to discussion...</div>
