<div><b>Translator Required (Commercial Opportunity)
</b><br/><br/>Hello folks, I am posting on behalf of a client who is looking for someone able to provide consultancy on German Heraldry and the translation of blazons from German into English. This would involve payment in US dollars at a rate to be negotiated. If anyone is interested please send an e-mail to info@coadb.com (and mention my name!).<br/><br/>Full disclosure - I already provide similar services for French Heraldry and can vouch for the honesty of this client, but French to English is the limit of my language ability(!).<br/><br/>Best regards to all,<br/><br/>Karl<br/><br/></div>
