<div>I had a quick question regarding the doctrine of 'one man one coat' - meaning that each person should have only one coat of arms.<br/><br/>Because I'm not seeing that at all in the British Monarchy.<br/>The Queen has different arms for England, Scotland, Canada (and possibly others) - but those are variations on the same theme.<br/><br/>However, Prince Charles has two very different arms for Scotland and England, and extra banners for Rothesay, Cornwall, Wales, Canada and I'm probably missing a few.<br/><br/>What's the rationale? And what does that tell us about the doctrine of 'one man one coat' ?</div>
