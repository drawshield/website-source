<div>The notion of a 'family crest' - i.e. that the crest is shared by al descendants of the grantee with no differences - turns out to be opt-out.<br/><br/>While it is the default in Canada, one may get granted wildly different crests for their children, as evidenced in this grant.<br/><br/>I have nooo idea what happens upon the death of the original grantee - does the first child gets both their parents and their own crests?</div>
