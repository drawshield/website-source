<div>The City of Toronto in Canada was affected recently by a van plowing attack. While not a terrorist attack per se, the perperator copied the ISIS playbook.<br/><br/>In solidarity, here are the arms of Toronto. I think that the 'chief pale' is an innovation of the CHA, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>Arms: Or a chief-pale Azure;<br/><br/>Crest: Issuant from a mural crown Or charged with a heart Gules between two roses Argent barbed Vert seeded Or a mound Vert thereon a golden eagle wings raised proper;<br/><br/>Supporters: On a mound Vert rising above barry wavy Azure and Argent and charged with three pales wavy Azure fimbriated Argent dexter a beaver proper gorged with a cord Gules pendant therefrom a hexagon Or charged with an alder leaf Vert sinister a bear proper gorged with a cord Gules pendant therefrom a hexagon Or charged with a columbine flower Azure;</div>
