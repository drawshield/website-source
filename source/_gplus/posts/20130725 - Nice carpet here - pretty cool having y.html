<div>Nice carpet here - pretty cool having your arms in a custom weaved carpet. The story here is about the Canadian city of Winnipeg giving up its right to control who uses its coat of arms. As one of the comments to the story points out, they seem confused about whether it is a "logo" or a coat of arms- these are very different things governed by very different sets of laws.<br/><br/>Anyway, can anyone identify the object above the shield itself? Looks like a foot-stool to me but I'm probably wrong...</div>
