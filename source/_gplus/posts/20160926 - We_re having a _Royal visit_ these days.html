<div>We're having a 'Royal visit' these days in <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23canada/posts">#canada
</a>. I'm putting royal in quotes because we are not receiving the Queen, but Prince William and his family.<br/><br/>So, here is his flag for use in Canada. Note the blazon for the golden circle around the the blue circle "hurt environed by maple leaves and escallops..."</div>
