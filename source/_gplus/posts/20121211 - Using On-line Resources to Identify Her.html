<div><b>Using On-line Resources to Identify Heraldry
</b><br/><br/>Hello folks! I've just written a brief guide to using on-line resources (<a href="http://archive.org">archive.org
</a> / google etc.) as a way to find out who owns a particular item of heraldry. It is at <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/identification/">http://karlwilcox.com/identification/
</a> Please take a look - comments and suggestions always welcome!<br/><br/>Thanks all,<br/><br/>Karl</div>
