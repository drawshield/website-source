<div>Question, I have a client who wants to represent his Italian heritage with the crest as we have done the rest of the arms and he's happy with it and he doesn't want to use the colors of the flag. Any ideas on a good crest that might somehow represent Italy, without putting the flying spaghetti monster up there???</div>
