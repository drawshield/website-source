<div>Unless you've been living under a rock, you probably know that it was Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday today.  <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23HappyBirthdayYourMajesty/posts">#HappyBirthdayYourMajesty
</a> <br/><br/>She is the queen of many countries, and thus has lots of arms we can display. So I'll show her arms as Queen of Scotland today.<br/><br/>I've copy-pasted the arms from Wikipedia - you should notice discrepancies between the blazon and the achievement. Can you tell what they are?<br/><br/>Arms: Quarterly, First and Fourth Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), Second quarter Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), Third quarter Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Order of the Thistle; <br/><br/>Crest: upon the Royal helm the imperial crown Proper, a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a scepter both erect and Proper, motto ‘In defens’; <br/>Mantling Or and ermine; <br/>Supporters: dexter a unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or, supporting a tilting lance proper flying a banner Azure, a saltire Argent (Cross of Saint Andrew); sinister a lion rampant guardant Or imperially crowned Proper, supporting a tilting lance proper flying a banner Argent, a cross Gules (Cross of Saint George); <br/><br/>Motto: 'Nemo me impune lacessit' in the compartment below the shield, with the thistle.</div>
