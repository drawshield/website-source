<div>*Drawshield and Parker's Dictionary Maintenance *<br/><br/>The Drawshield and Parker's Dictionary of Heraldry websites will be off-line for a while tonight (Sunday 19th). They both use Wordpress and I have been a bit slack with updates, with the result that I have to do manual updates to version 3.8.<br/><br/>Regarding Parker's, don't forget that you can add your own comments to the entries in the dictionary, just scroll down to the form at the bottom of each page and enter the information. Logins are NOT required.<br/><br/>Best regards, Karl (the lazy sys admin!)</div>
