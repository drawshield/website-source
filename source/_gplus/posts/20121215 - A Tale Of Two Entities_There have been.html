<div><b>A Tale Of Two Entities
</b><br/><br/>There have been two stories in the past weeks both about corporate rebranding exercises. Both organisations had corporate identities based on a coat of arms and both wanted to give their identities a more modern feel. I will admit that a coat of arms can seem old-fashioned and outdated and can understand a wish to modernise the look.<br/><br/>You can see before and after images of the rebranding below. The two organisations are the Office of the Bishop of London and the University of California.<br/><br/>I'll let the images speak for themselves and open up the discussion. What is your opinion on these rebrandings, are they good, bad or indifferent?<br/><br/>Sources:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2012/december/a-new-logo-for-the-diocese-of-london">http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2012/december/a-new-logo-for-the-diocese-of-london
