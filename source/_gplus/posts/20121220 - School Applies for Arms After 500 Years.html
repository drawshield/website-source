</a><br/><br/>You can't see it very well in the photo (we want to see Heraldry not a bunch of ex-students and local worthies!) but as far as I can make out it is:<br/><br/><i>Gules, a lion rampant or langued and armed azure holding a book of the last bound of the second, all within an orle of eight cross-crosslets (also or?)
</i><br/><br/>Both the secondary (US = "High") school that I attended, and the one here in the village have what you might call "cod" heraldic badges (or "heraldish"?) that were obviously designed by someone who had seen a few coats of arms but didn't really have any idea what they doing, splattering charges and words all over the place!</div>
