<div><b>"Meaning" Of Symbols?
</b><br/><br/>A nicely illustrated article about the arms of the City of Kamloops in British Columbia. We need to be aware however that these are not really the "meanings" of the symbols - what the article explains is the reason behind the choice of symbol <i>for that particular coat of arms
</i> .<br/><br/>Hence, for the city of Kamloops the ermine background represents the fur trade, but it does not "mean" that in other contexts!<br/><br/>(Just being pedantic here!)</div>
