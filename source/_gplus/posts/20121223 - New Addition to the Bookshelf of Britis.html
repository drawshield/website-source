<div><b>New Addition to the Bookshelf of British Heraldry
</b><br/><br/>I have just added a new "Essential" book to the bookshelf of British Heraldry ( <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/heraldrybookshelf">http://karlwilcox.com/heraldrybookshelf
</a> ):- <i>The Book of Public Arms
</i> by the prolific author A.C. Fox-Davies. Archive.org has an excellently reproduced fully text-searchable copy of the 1915 edition. This useful book has an alphabetical list of Town, County, Organisation, and other "non-family"  arms. There are about 4,000 entries of which 1,500 are illustrated by clear line drawings. An essential adjunct to Burke's <i>General Armory
</i> and Fox-Davies' own <i>Armorial Families
</i>.<br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23heraldry/posts">#heraldry
