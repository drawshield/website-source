<div>Let me share some arms I saw in my recent visit of the Eastern Townships, a region in the Province of Quebec.<br/><br/>First, the arms of Bishop's University. As you can guess, those are gonna have a canting side :)<br/><br/>Arms Argent on a cross of St. George an open book proper bound and edged Or in the first quarter two croziers in saltire Gules;<br/><br/>Crest A closed book laid flat bound Purpure edged Argent thereon a mitre Argent orphreys Purpure charged with fleurs-de-lys and maple leaves alternately Argent the infulae Purpure;<br/><br/>Supporters On a compartment composed of grassy mounds charged with a pall wavy Argent dexter a white tailed stag (Odocoileus virginianus) Argent unguled and attired Purpure sinister a bear (Ursus americanus) Argent armed Purpure supporting a staff flying therefrom to the sinister the Flag of Bishop's University;<br/><br/>Motto RECTI CULTUS PECTORA ROBORANT. This Latin phrase means "Good learning habits strengthen the hearts".<br/></div>
