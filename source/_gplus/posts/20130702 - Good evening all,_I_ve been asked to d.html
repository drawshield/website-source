<div>Good evening all,<br/><br/>I've been asked to design a shield for a friend who's family motto is "After the rain comes the sun" but in latin of course!<br/><br/>My idea is to split the shield in two and have a dark and a light side. I've found a nice heraldic sun for the light side but I need some heraldic clouds for the dark side. I don't want to draw them freehand if there are some nice examples of what others have done or indeed a "standard cloud".<br/><br/>Any pointers / links / images are gratefully received!</div>
