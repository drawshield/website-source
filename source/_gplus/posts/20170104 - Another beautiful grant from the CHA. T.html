<div>Another beautiful grant from the CHA. This time to Denis Racine.<br/><br/>No crests, helm nor mantling, and the shield is drawn in the modern French style.<br/>The subtext is pretty clear - 'I descended from the French and I'll have my coat of arms the French way, thank you very much'<br/><br/>I like it so much that I'm considering a grant without crest.<br/><br/>P.S. French arms sometimes have crests and supporters, but the most common form I'm seeing remains the 'naked' shield.</div>
