<div>Ok for you guys interested let me explain the symbolism used. The rotweiler reminds him of his days in the South African Air Force as a dog handler. The eagle on the helmet refers to both the airforce and his pilots license. The ermine spots represents his two sons and a daughter, that is why one is diffrent. The winged lion reflects his love of flying, his strong personality and the lions head is similar to SAAB vehicles. He owns a SAAB aircraft but their logo is not suitable. The lion also miss a digit on the one claw as does my friend. The blue and white both represents the airforce colours and the sky. Now one day when I learn to blazon I will give it to him as a gift.<br/></div>
