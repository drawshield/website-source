<div><b>Cadillac Logo Based on Real Heraldry
</b><br/><br/>Well, who knew? We don't get many Cadillacs over in the UK so I've not had the opportunity to notice the badge too closely before. Despite its abstract appearance, the Cadillac Logo is apparently based on the arms ofÂ Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, according to this article in the NY Times...<br/><br/>(May be pay-walled in the US? I can see it fine from the UK)</div>
