<div><b>Heraldry Tutorial
</b><br/><br/>You folks probably know most of this stuff already, but if you have friends that would like an on-line introduction to Heraldry this set of blog posts is nicely written. It is based on "Boutell's Heraldry", which was also the inspiration for <a href="http://karlwilcox.com/drawshield">http://karlwilcox.com/drawshield
</a> so almost all of the things discussed in the blog posts can be created in Drawshield, if you want to work through some practical exercises.</div>
