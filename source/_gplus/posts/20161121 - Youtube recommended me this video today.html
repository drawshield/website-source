<div>Youtube recommended me this video today. Though related to heraldry, it is mostly speeches - so not everybody's cup of tea. I like the ceremonial side of it though.<br/><br/>Ontario was the first province of Canada to obtain arms for their legislative assembly. The granting ceremony happened in 1995. The proclamation itself starts around the 20th minute.<br/><br/>If you'd rather just look at the arms - skip to the Register at <a href="http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1607">http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1607
