<h2>Width of Bars</h2>

<p>Back when I started DrawShield I knew more about programming than I did about heraldry so when it came to implementing bars, palets and bendlets I wrote some clever code! This code allowed you to draw any number of bars, palets and bendlets and it would adjust the widths and spacing of the items so that they would fit into the available space.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the sake of heraldic accuracy a correspondent very gently pointed that things don't work like that! Each of these items, sometimes known as diminutives, has a defined width, relative to width of its "parent" ordinary. And, there are other named diminutives that have even narrower widths</p>

<p>So I rewrote things for greater accuracy and to add the missing diminutives. The only remaining issue is how wide each of these items should be. There seems to be fair degree of "artists' licence" but here are examples of the relative widths as currently implemented by DrawShield</p>

<h3>The Fess and its diminutives</h3>

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="/blog/img/bars.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="argent a fess azure, a bar vert, a closet sable, a barrulet gules">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">argent a fess azure, a bar vert, a closet sable, a barrulet gules.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Note, that as far as I am aware, there is no equivalent of the <em>closet</em> for the pale and the bend.</p>


<h3>The Pale and its diminutives</h3>

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="/blog/img/pales.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="argent a pale azure, a palet vert, an endorse gules">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">argent a pale azure, a palet vert, an endorse gules.</figcaption>
  </figure>


<h3>The Bend and its diminutives</h3>

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="/blog/img/bends.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="argent a bend azure, a bendlet vert, a riband gules">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">argent a bend azure, a bendlet vert, a riband sable, .</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Note that there is also a <em>scarpe</em>, which is just a bendlet sinister.</p>
