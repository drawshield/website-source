<!-- /catalog/charges/Lion/index.html starts -->
<p>The lions can be drawn in  postures such as <span class="keyword">rampant, passant, cadent, couchant, courant, salient, sejeant, passant, statant</span>, with its head <span class="keyword">guardant, reguardant</span> and its tail <span class="keyword">fourche, nowed, saltire</span> and possibly some others. You can specify any combination of the above and DrawShield will use the closest available, warning about anything it cannot handle.</p>

<p>There are other modifiers that may also be available, for example <span class="keyword">lion's head crowned</span>.</p> 

<p>Finally, note the discussion on the use of the term <span class="keyword">leopard</span>, (which sometimes means "lion") under <a href="/catalog/charges/animal/index.html">animals</a>.</p>
