pageTitle: Symmetrical Crosses
---
<!-- /catalog/charges/Quadrate/index.html starts -->
<p>These crosses are all largely symmetrical (unless you chose to make them <span class="example">fitchy at the foot.</span>. There are additional <a href="/catalog/charges/cross/index.html">named crosses</a>  also available.</p>

<p>Arguably the compass rose is a nautical item but is included here so it can be compared with the various compass stars.</p>
