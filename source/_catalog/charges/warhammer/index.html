<p>These symbols are all from the excellent collection at <a href="http://bakadesign.dk/warhammer-40-000-icons/">http://bakadesign.dk/warhammer-40-000-icons/</a> and thanks are due to the original creators. Ownership and copyright of the designs resides with Games Workshop.</p>

<p>Each of the charges can be described in two ways, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>the symbol of the steel legion</em></li>
    <li><em>the steel legion symbol</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Note also that if you select the Pauldron shape the complete range of Warhammer paint colours can be used with these charges - if you want to use Warhammer colours in other shield shapes then you will need to enable them under the "Colour Scheme" section of the <strong>Preferences</strong>.</p>
