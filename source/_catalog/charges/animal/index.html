<p>General animals - note that there are many types of animals in more specific categories such as <a href="/catalog/charges/lion/index.html">lions</a>, <a href="/catalog/charges/wildlife/index.html">British Wildlife</a> and so on. Animals in this category don't really fit anywhere else.</p>

<h3>The Leopard</h3>

<p>The leopard has a complex relationship with heraldry and its representation has changed over time. DrawShield implements the leopard as follows:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard</span></dt>
	<dd>This is treated as a synonym for <span class="keyword">Lion passant guardant</span> and drawn the same way. This is also the case for <span class="keyword">lion leoparde</span>.</dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Natural Leopard</span></dt>
	<dd>(Or  <span class="keyword">Spotted Leopard</span>) is the heraldic version of the actual leopard. It may be <span class="keyword">Spotted</span> of a different tincture, in which case it is probably best to use a construction such as <span class="keyword">a natural leopard or spotted sable</span></dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard's Head</span></dt>
	<dd>Is the heraldic version of the actual leopard's head.</dd>
	<dt><span class="keyword">Leopard (head) jessant de lys</span></dt>
	<dd>Is the peculiar but common Heraldic charge consisting of a Leopard's Head pierced by a fleur-de-lys. The Fleur-de-lys can be a different tincture, e.g. <span class="keyword">a leopard's head gules jessant-de-lys or</span>.</dd>
