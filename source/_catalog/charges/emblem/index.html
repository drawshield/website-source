<p>The <span class="example">menorah</span> by default has 7 branches but you may also use <span class="example">a menorah of 9 branches</span>, both versions may be <span class="example">enflamed</span> of a different colour. The <span class="example">triskelion</span> by default is a simple spiral, but can be <span class="example">armoured</span> to appear as 3 armoured legs, as found in the arms of the Isle of Man, or alternatively formed <span class="example">of spirals</span>. The fasces can be <span class="example">bladed</span> and the herald's staff can be <span class="example">ribboned</span> of a different tincture. Finally, the <span class="example">nesselblatt</span> is a stylised nettle leaf found in German heraldy.</p>
