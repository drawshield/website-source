<!-- /catalog/charges/Crown/index.html starts -->
<p>In most cases the words "crown" and "coronet" are interchangeable. The mural crown may also be described as <span class="keyword">mortared</span> of a different tincture. (This should really be <span class="keyword">masoned</span> but this gets confused with the treatment of the same name).</p>
