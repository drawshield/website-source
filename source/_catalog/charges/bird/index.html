<!-- /catalog/charges/Bird/index.html starts -->
<p>Note that there are specific categories for <a href="/catalog/charges/hawking/index.html">birds involved in hunting</a> and <a href="/catalog/charges/seabird/index.html">sea birds</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to complete birds, the following parts are also available: <span class="keyword">feather, ostrich feather, wing,  a pair of wings (conjoined), a pair of wings (conjoined) in lure</span>. The feather may be <span class="keyword">quilled</span> of a different colour. Note that <span class="keyword">2 wings argent</span> gives you two separate white wings both in the same orientation, while <span class="keyword">2 wings respecting each other argent</span> gives you two white wings opposite each other with a gap. If you really want two wings together you <em>must</em> use one of the <span class="keyword">pair of wings</span> variants.</p>
