<p>Roundels are such common charges that each colour roundel has its own special name, so it is an error if these are given a colour. These are:</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Bezant, golpe, guze, hurt, orange, pellet, plate, pomme, torteau</span></p>

<p>The matching of name to heraldic tincture is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>The <span class="example">bounding box</span> is a special charge that can be used to debug placement problems. The normal "up" direction is clearly indicated and the shape will expand to fit all of the space available for a charge.</p>
