<p>In addition to entire trees, many of them can be reprensted by a single <span class="keyword">leaf</span>, or a representative branch known as a <span class="keyword">sprig</span>, for example <span class="example">a beech sprig proper</span>. If the branch includes fruits or berries it might be possible to give these a different tincture using the feature <span class="keyword">fructed</span>.</p>
