<!-- /catalog/charges/Cross/index.html starts -->
<p>These are crosses that are named after specific people or locations. There are also a large number of   <a href="/catalog/charges/quadrate/index.html">4-way symmetrical crosses</a>. Note that a single <span class="example">cross</span> is an ordinary that covers the widht and height of the field, more than one cross are shown as in the <span class="example">3 crosses</span> example below. If you want a single cross that can be placed anywhere as a charge used one of the <span class="example">crosslet</span>, <span class="example">cross couped</span> or <span class="example">cross calvary</span>. The <span class="example">crosslet</span> is quite thin, while the <span class="example">cross couped</span> is thicker, more like the cross on the Swiss flag.</p>
