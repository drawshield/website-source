pageTitle: Common Edge Varations

<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains thumbnail images of most of the variant edges commonly found in British Heraldry. There are also many variations of <span class="keyword">embattled</span> so these have been removed to their own category.</p>
<p>In addition the use of <span class="keyword">bevilled opposite</span> and <span class="keyword">angled opposite</span> are <em>non-standard</em> heraldic terms to indicate that the step should go the "other" way. I do not know of a correct heraldic construction for this. (For compatibility reasons the word <span class="keyword">upper</span> can be used instead of <span class="keyword">opposite</span> but I prefer the latter).
