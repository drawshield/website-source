pageTitle: Edge Types
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains thumbnail images of most of the variant edge types that Drawshield can use, organised into largely arbitrary categories. These edges can be applied to most of the oridinaries and divisions, although not all work convincingly on every shape. There are particular problems with applying any edge to the plain cross and the edges shown in the <strong>Ornate</strong> are very large and really only work on the largest and simplest shapes.
