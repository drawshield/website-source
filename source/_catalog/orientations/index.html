pageTitle: Orientation of Charges 
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains thumbnail images of most of the ways of changing the orientation of charges. Most charges have a default orientation - i.e. they normally face in a set direction and have a defined "upright" position. This can be changed by using the following modifiers after the charge. They can be used in combination also. The charges "axe" and "salmon" are also shown with no modifiers to allow comparison with their modified orientation.</p>

<p>Although orientation may seem to the same concept as arrangement, it is different because you can combine both orientation and arrangement, for example charges may be <span class="example">fesswise in pale</span> (orientated in a particular arrangement), and this is different from <span class="example">in pale</span> on its own.</p>

<h2>Orientation of Ordinaries</h2>

<p>With ordinaries, the only modifiers for orientation that can be used are <span class="keyword">reversed</span> and <span class="keyword">inverted</span>; these are pretty interchangeable and usually mean "the other way around".</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>When charges are placed <span class="example">on</span> an ordinary they will sometimes automatically have an orientation applied to better match them to the ordinary, for example birds are typically orientated <span class="example">bendwise sinister</span> when placed <span class="example">on a bend</span>. This can be over-ridden by specifying your own orientation.</p>
