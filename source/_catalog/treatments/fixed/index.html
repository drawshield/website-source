pageTitle: Treatments of Fixed Colours
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>These treatments have "objects" (roundels) that are a fixed colour. They are hence an exception to the general rule for specifying treatments and are specified in the blazon as <span class="keyword">[tincture] [treatment]</span>. If you want to have roundels of other colours use the treatment <span class="keyword">roundelly</span>.
