pageTitle: Woven Fabric Patterns
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>These patterns are NOT heraldic but were easily added, and might be useful. They can used wherever treatments can be used.
    They work best with colours only as furs and other patterns are of a similar size and rather odd results may occur.
</p>

<p>The <em>tartan pattern</em> must be followed by a set of colour name / thread count pairs. <strong>Only colours</strong>
may be used and the thread counts must be numbers. Assume that there are about 500 threads across the width of the field. If you
do NOT want the pattern to repeat use <em>tartan no repeat</em>.</p>
