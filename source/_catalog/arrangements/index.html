pageTitle: Arrangements of Charges 
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains thumbnail images of most of the ways of arranging charges. By default, charges get arranged in a sort of triangular arrangement depending on how many there are and whether the space availalble is wide or narrow. Note that not all arrangements are valid for every number - a warning will be generated if an invalid arrangement is requested.</p>
