<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>There are two approaches to achievements, you can build them out of component parts, or you can choose a complete achievement for a specific category of person.</p>

<p>Component parts are shown separately, the complete achievements are grouped by the "organisation" that owns them.</p>
