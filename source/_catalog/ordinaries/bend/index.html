pageTitle: Bend Variations
---
<!-- /catalog/ordinaries/major/index.html starts -->
<p>These are the available variations of the bend. All of them can be flipped by appending the word <span class="keyword">sinister</span>, except the <span class="keyword">baton</span>, which is sinister by default. If can be flipped by using <span class="keyword">baton dexter</span>. Some can also take variant edge types, as indicated by the plus symbols. Experiment shows that here can be up to 3 repetitions of  the <span class="keyword">bendlet</span> and up to 8 of the <span class="keyword">riband</span> but they become increasingly indistinguishable from the corresponding <span class="keyword">bendy</span>.</p>
