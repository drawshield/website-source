<!-- /catalog/ordinaries/major/index.html starts -->
<p>These are the most common ordinaries, being large and clearly recognisable. Most can take variant edge types, as indicated by the plus symbols, and those that are asymmetrical can be flipped by following them with the word <span class="keyword">sinister</span>, see "point" for an example.</p>
