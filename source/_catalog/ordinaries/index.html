<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains thumbnail images of most of the ordinaries that Drawshield can use, organised into largely arbitrary categories. Note that ordinaries appear in more than one category, for example the chevronel appears in the list of "diminutives" (since it is a smaller version of the chevron), and also the "chevron variations" category. Some of the ordinaries, typically the larger ones, can be given different edge types, indicated by a plus after their names.
