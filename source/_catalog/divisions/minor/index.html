pageTitle: Minor Divisions
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains less common divisions. The quarterly divisions can take any of the
    variant edge types, the wavy edges are just provided as examples.
</p>

<p>Note that <em>per chief</em> is explictly a division of the field, i.e. it is just a way
	of splitting the field into two parts of different tinctures. It has <strong>no effect</strong>
	on the placement of other charges or anything else - this is in contrast to the ordinary known
	as the <em>chief</em>, it has a similar visual appearance but other charges and ordinaries will
	be placed differently, in order to respect the presence of the chief ordinary.</p>

<p>To see the difference for yourself, compare:</p>

<p><em>argent a chief vert 3 pellets</em></p>

<p><em>per chief vert and argent 3 pellets</em></p>

<p>You will note that the pellets are moved down in the first, to be below the chief, but overlap the chief in the second</p>
