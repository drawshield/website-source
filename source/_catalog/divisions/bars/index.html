pageTitle: Divisions of Multiple Bars
---
<!-- /blog/index.html starts -->
<p>This section contains divisions containing multiple bars. These are different to
    ordinaries of multiple bars as the divsion bars are spread evenly across the whole field.
</p>

<p>Note also that the number of "bars" can be specified for all of these variations, from anywhere between 1 and 64. Numbers below 4 look strange and numbers above 16 are pretty indistinguisable. Examples of some of the more useful numbers for barry are shown.</p>
