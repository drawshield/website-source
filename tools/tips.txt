:tip: In annullo
You can arrange charges in a circle by using "in annullo". This obviously works better if there are
8 or more - unless you are a dragon, in which case you can be in annullo all by yourself...

:joke: Bad joke 1
Did you hear about the herald who drew 3 lions in a bucket of water? The client told him he wanted
them "in pail"...

:tip: Colouring sheets
Colouring stuff in is cool! Design your arms, use the preferences pane to set the palette to
"outline" then click on the "Print Shield" button. That will open a new browser tab that you
can print and start colouring.

:tip: Item finder 1
Looking for a particular charge? Can't remember how to spell "amphiptere"? These and other
questions can be answered using the "Item Finder" on the top page of the visual catalog,
just start typing to see all matches...

:fact: Glass slipper
So Cinderella wore glass slippers huh? Sounds kinda dangerous and uncomfortable... In the original

we heralds would make...
